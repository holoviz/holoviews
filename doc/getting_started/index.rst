Welcome to HoloViews!
=====================

This 'Getting Started' guide aims to get you using HoloViews
productively as quickly as possible. It is designed as an entry point for
new users that will introduce the core concepts necessary to get you
working productively with your own data. We recommend reading this guide
in order if you wish to get an overview of what is offered by HoloViews.

For detailed documentation, please consult our `User Guide
<../user_guide/index.html>`_ which we will link to from the appropriate
sections of this guide. An overview of some interesting HoloViews
examples can be found in our `Gallery <../gallery/index.html>`_ and if
you are looking for a specific component (or wish to view the available
range of primitives), see our `Reference Gallery.
