Installation
____________

HoloViews works with Python `2.7 and Python 3
<https://travis-ci.org/ioam/holoviews>`_.  HoloViews is pure Python, but
it also provides optional extensions enabled with
``hv.notebook_extension()`` above that make it integrate well with
`Jupyter/IPython Notebook <http://jupyter.org>`_ versions 3, 4 and 5.

The quickest and easiest way to get the latest version of all the
recommended packages for working with HoloViews on Linux, Windows, or
Mac systems is via the
`conda <http://conda.pydata.org/docs/>`_ command provided by 
the `Anaconda <http://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install>`_ or
`Miniconda <http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html>`_ scientific
Python distributions::

  conda install -c ioam holoviews bokeh

See our `installation page <install.html>`_ if you need other options,
including `pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing>`_
installations, additional packages, development versions, and minimal
installations.  Minimal installations include only `Param
<http://ioam.github.com/param/>`_ and `Numpy <http://numpy.org>`_ as
dependencies, neither of which has any required dependencies, making
it simple to generate HoloViews objects from within your own code.

Usage
-----

Once you've installed HoloViews, you can get started by launching
Jupyter Notebook::

  jupyter notebook

Now you can download the `tutorial notebooks`_.  unzip them somewhere
Jupyter Notebook can find them, and then open the Homepage.ipynb
tutorial or any of the others in the Notebook.  Enjoy exploring your
data!

Note: When running HoloViews in Jupyter Notebook 5.0 a data rate limit
was introduced which severely limits the output that HoloViews can
display.  This limit will be removed again in the upcoming 5.1
release, in the meantime you can raise the limit manually by
overriding the default ``iopub_data_rate_limit``::

   jupyter notebook --NotebookApp.iopub_data_rate_limit=100000000

Alternatively you can set a higher default in the user configuration file
in ``~/.jupyter/jupyter_notebook_config.py``, by adding::

   c.NotebookApp.iopub_data_rate_limit=100000000

If the configuration file does not exist generate one first using::

   jupyter notebook --generate-config
