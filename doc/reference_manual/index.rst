API Reference Manual
********************

To learn how to use HoloViews, we recommend that people start with the
`Getting Started guide`_, and then use the online help features from within
IPython Notebook to learn more.  Each option should have corresponding
tab-completion and help provided, and this is usually enough to
determine how to use the HoloViews components.

Even so, for a truly comprehensive reference to every object in
HoloViews, we provide this API documentation. The API reference manual
is generated directly from documentation and declarations in the
source code, and is thus often much more verbose than necessary,
because many little-used yet often-duplicated methods are listed for
each class.  Still, the reference for a given component does provide a
comprehensive listing of all attributes and methods, inherited or
otherwise, which is can be difficult to obtain from the source code
directly.
