  (`#4932 <https://github.com/holoviz/holoviews/pull/4932>`_)
- Ensure ``Area.stack`` keeps labels
  (`#4937 <https://github.com/holoviz/holoviews/pull/4937>`_)

Documentation:

- Updated Dashboards user guide to show ``pn.bind`` first
  (`#4907 <https://github.com/holoviz/holoviews/pull/4907>`_)
- Updated docs to correctly declare Scatter kdims
  (`#4914 <https://github.com/holoviz/holoviews/pull/4914>`_)

Compatibility:

Unfortunately a number of tile sources are no longer publicly available.
Attempting to use these tile sources will now issue warnings unless
``hv.config.raise_deprecated_tilesource_exception`` is set to ``True``
in which case exceptions will be raised instead.

-  The ``Wikipedia`` tile source is no longer available as it is no
   longer being served outside the wikimedia domain. As one of the most
   frequently used tile sources, HoloViews now issues a warning and
   switches to the OpenStreetMap (OSM) tile source instead.
-  The ``CartoMidnight`` and ``CartoEco`` tile sources are no longer
   publicly available. Attempting to use these tile sources will result
   in a deprecation warning.

Version 1.14.0
**************

Date: 2020-12-03

This release brings a number of major features including a new
IbisInterface, new Plotly Dash support and greatly improved Plotly
support, and greatly improved interaction and integration with
Datashader. Many thanks to the many contributors to this release,
whether directly by submitting PRs or by reporting issues and making
suggestions. Specifically, we would like to thank @philippjfr,
@jonmmease, and @tonyfast for their work on the IbisInterface and
@jonmmease for improving Plotly support, as well as @kcpevey, @Hoxbro,
@marckassay, @mcepl, and @ceball for various other enhancements,
improvements to documentation and testing infrastructure. In addition,
thanks to the maintainers @jbednar, @jlstevens and @philippjfr for
contributing to this release. This version includes a large number of
new features, enhancements, and bug fixes.

It is important to note that version 1.14 will be the last HoloViews
release supporting Python 2.

Major features:

-  New Plotly Dash support
   (`#4605 <https://github.com/holoviz/holoviews/pull/4605>`__)
-  New Plotly support for Tiles element
   (`#4686 <https://github.com/holoviz/holoviews/pull/4686>`__)
-  New IbisInterface
   (`#4517 <https://github.com/holoviz/holoviews/pull/4517>`__)
-  Greatly improved Datashader ``rasterize()``
   (`#4567 <https://github.com/holoviz/holoviews/pull/4567>`__).
   Previously, many of the features of Datashader were available only
   through ``datashade``, which rendered data all the way to RGB pixels
   and thus prevented many client-side Bokeh features like hover,
   colorbars, dynamic colormaps, etc. ``rasterize`` now supports all
   these Bokeh features along with nearly all the Datashader features
   previously only available through ``datashade``, including (now
   client-side) histogram equalization with ``cnorm='eq_hist'`` and easy
   control of transparency via a new ``Dimension.nodata`` parameter.
   See the `Large Data User Guide
   <https://holoviews.org/user_guide/Large_Data.html>`__ for more
   information.

Enhancements:

-  Implemented datashader aggregation of Rectangles
   (`#4701 <https://github.com/holoviz/holoviews/pull/4701>`__)
-  New support for robust color limits (``clim_percentile``)
   (`#4712 <https://github.com/holoviz/holoviews/pull/4712>`__)
-  Support for dynamic overlays in link_selections
   (`#4683 <https://github.com/holoviz/holoviews/pull/4683>`__)
-  Allow clashing Param stream contents
   (`#4677 <https://github.com/holoviz/holoviews/pull/4677>`__)
-  Ensured pandas does not convert times to UTC
   (`#4711 <https://github.com/holoviz/holoviews/pull/4711>`__)
-  Removed all use of cyordereddict
   (`#4620 <https://github.com/holoviz/holoviews/pull/4620>`__)
-  Testing infrastructure moved to GH Actions
   (`#4592 <https://github.com/holoviz/holoviews/pull/4592>`__)

Bug fixes:

-  Ensure RangeXY returns x/y ranges in correct order (#4665)
   (`#4665 <https://github.com/holoviz/holoviews/pull/4665>`__)
-  Fix datashader instability with Plotly by disabling padding for RGB
   elements (`#4705 <https://github.com/holoviz/holoviews/pull/4705>`__)
-  Various Dask and cuDF histogram fixes
   (`#4691 <https://github.com/holoviz/holoviews/pull/4691>`__)
-  Fix handling of custom matplotlib and bokeh colormaps
   (`#4693 <https://github.com/holoviz/holoviews/pull/4693>`__)
-  Fix cuDF values implementation
   (`#4687 <https://github.com/holoviz/holoviews/pull/4687>`__)
-  Fixed range calculation on HexTiles
   (`#4689 <https://github.com/holoviz/holoviews/pull/4689>`__)
-  Use PIL for RGB.load_image
   (`#4639 <https://github.com/holoviz/holoviews/pull/4639>`__)

Documentation:

-  Clarified data types accepted by Points
   (`#4430 <https://github.com/holoviz/holoviews/pull/4430>`__)
-  Updated Introduction notebook
   (`#4682 <https://github.com/holoviz/holoviews/pull/4682>`__)
-  Fixed releases urls
   (`#4672 <https://github.com/holoviz/holoviews/pull/4672>`__)

Compatibility:

-  Warning when there are multiple kdims on Chart elements
   (`#4710 <https://github.com/holoviz/holoviews/pull/4710>`__)
-  Set histogram ``normed`` option to False by default
   (`#4258 <https://github.com/holoviz/holoviews/pull/4258>`__)
-  The default colormap in holoviews is now ‘kbc_r’ instead of ‘fire’;
   see issue
   `#3500 <https://github.com/holoviz/holoviews/issues/3500>`__ for
   details. This change was made mainly because the highest value of the
   fire colormap is white, which meant data was often not visible
   against a white background. To restore the old behavior you can set
   ``hv.config.default_cmap='fire'``, which you can do via the extension
   e.g. ``hv.extension('bokeh', config=dict(default_cmap='fire'))``.
   There is also ``hv.config.default_gridded_cmap`` which you can set to
   ‘fire’ if you wish to use the old colormap for the ``Raster``,
   ``Image`` and ``QuadMesh`` element types. The default ``HeatMap``
   colormap has also been set to ‘kbc_r’ for consistency and can be set
   back to the old value of ‘RdYlBu_r’ via
   ``hv.config.default_heatmap_cmap``.

Version 1.11.0
**************

This is a major release containing a large number of features and API
improvements. Specifically this release was devoted to improving the
general usability and accessibility of the HoloViews API and
deprecating parts of the API in anticipation for the 2.0 release.
To enable deprecation warnings for these deprecations set:

.. code-block::

   hv.config.future_deprecations = True


The largest updates to the API relate to the options system which is now
more consistent, has better validation and better supports notebook
users without requiring IPython magics. The new ``dim`` transform
generalizes the mapping from data dimensions to visual dimensions,
greatly increasing the expressive power of the options system. Please
consult the updated user guides for more information.

Julia Signell (@jsignell), Jon Mease (@jonmmease), and Zachary Barry
(@zbarry).

Version 1.7
~~~~~~~~~~~

Version 1.7.0
*************

This version is a major new release incorporating seven months of work
involving several hundred PRs and over 1700 commits. Highlights include
extensive new support for easily building highly interactive
`Bokeh <http://bokeh.pydata.org>`__ plots, support for using
`datashader <https://github.com/bokeh/datashader>`__-based plots for
working with large datasets, support for rendering images interactively
but outside of the notebook, better error handling, and support for
Matplotlib 2.0 and Bokeh 0.12.5. The PRs linked below serve as initial
documentation for these features, and full documentation will be added
in the run-up to HoloViews 2.0.

Version 1.4.1
*************

Over the past two weeks since the 1.4 release, we have implemented
several important bug fixes and have made several usability
improvements.

New features:

-  Improved help system. It is now possible to recursively list all the
   applicable documentation for a composite object. In addition, the
   documentation may now be filtered using a regular expression pattern.
   (`PR #370 <https://github.com/pyviz/holoviews/pull/370>`__)
-  HoloViews now supports multiple active display hooks making it easier
   to use nbconvert. For instance, PNG data will be embedded in the
   notebook if the argument display\_formats-['html','png'] is supplied
   to the notebook\_extension. (`PR
   #355 <https://github.com/pyviz/holoviews/pull/355>`__)
-  Improvements to the display of DynamicMaps as well as many new
   improvements to the Bokeh backend including better VLines/HLines and
   support for the Bars element. (`PR
   #367 <https://github.com/pyviz/holoviews/pull/367>`__ , `PR

   distributions as a sequence of lines or as a box-and-whisker plot.
   (`PR #346 <https://github.com/pyviz/holoviews/pull/346>`__, `PR
   #339 <https://github.com/pyviz/holoviews/pull/339>`__)
-  Improvements to the notebook\_extension. For instance, executing
   hv.notebook\_extension('bokeh') will now load BokehJS and
   automatically activate the Bokeh backend (if available).
-  Significant performance improvements when using the groupby operation
   on HoloMaps and when working with highly nested datastructures. (`PR
   #349 <https://github.com/pyviz/holoviews/pull/349>`__, `PR
   #359 <https://github.com/pyviz/holoviews/pull/359>`__)

Notable bug fixes:

   labels and values (`PR
   #376 <https://github.com/pyviz/holoviews/pull/376>`__).

Version 1.4.0
*************

Over the past few months we have added several major new features and
with the help of our users have been able to address a number of bugs
and inconsistencies. We have closed 57 issues and added over 1100 new
commits.

Major new features:

-  Data API: The new data API brings an extensible system of to add new
   data interfaces to column based Element types. These interfaces allow
   applying powerful operations on the data independently of the data
   format. The currently supported datatypes include NumPy, pandas
   dataframes and a simple dictionary format. (`PR
   #284 <https://github.com/pyviz/holoviews/pull/284>`__)
-  Backend API: In this release we completely refactored the rendering,
   plotting and IPython display system to make it easy to add new
   plotting backends. Data may be styled and pickled for each backend
   independently and renderers now support exporting all plotting data
   including widgets as standalone HTML files or with separate JSON
   data.
-  Bokeh backend: The first new plotting backend added via the new
   backend API. Bokeh plots allow for much faster plotting and greater
   interactivity. Supports most Element types and layouts and provides
   facilities for sharing axes across plots and linked brushing across
   plots. (`PR #250 <https://github.com/pyviz/holoviews/pull/250>`__)
-  DynamicMap: The new DynamicMap class allows HoloMap data to be
   generated on-the-fly while running a Jupyter IPython notebook kernel.
   Allows visualization of unbounded data streams and smooth exploration
   of large continuous parameter spaces. (`PR
   #278 <https://github.com/pyviz/holoviews/pull/278>`__)

Other features:

-  Easy definition of custom aliases for group, label and Dimension
   names, allowing easier use of LaTeX.
-  New Trisurface and QuadMesh elements.
-  Widgets now allow expressing hierarchical relationships between
   dimensions.
-  Added GridMatrix container for heterogeneous Elements and gridmatrix
   operation to generate scatter matrix showing relationship between
   dimensions.
-  Filled contour regions can now be generated using the contours
   operation.
-  Consistent indexing semantics for all Elements and support for
   boolean indexing for Columns and NdMapping types.
-  New hv.notebook\_extension function offers a more flexible
   alternative to %load\_ext, e.g. for loading other extensions
   hv.notebook\_extension(bokeh-True).

Experimental features:

-  Bokeh callbacks allow adding interactivity by communicating between
   BokehJS tools and the IPython kernel, e.g. allowing downsampling
   based on the zoom level.

Version 1.3.0
*************

Since the last release we closed over 34 issues and have made 380
commits mostly focused on fixing bugs, cleaning up the API and working
extensively on the plotting and rendering system to ensure HoloViews is
fully backend independent.

We'd again like to thank our growing user base for all their input,
which has helped us in making the API more understandable and fixing a
number of important bugs.

Highlights/Features:

-  Allowed display of data structures which do not match the recommended
   nesting hierarchy (67b28f3, fbd89c3).
-  Dimensions now sanitized for ``.select``, ``.sample`` and ``.reduce``
   calls (6685633, 00b5a66).
-  Added ``holoviews.ipython.display`` function to render (and display)
   any HoloViews object, useful for IPython interact widgets (0fa49cd).
-  Table column widths now adapt to cell contents (be90a54).
-  Defaulting to Matplotlib ticking behavior (62e1e58).
-  Allowed specifying fixed figure sizes to Matplotlib via
   ``fig_inches`` tuples using (width, None) and (None, height) formats
   (632facd).
-  Constructors of ``Chart``, ``Path`` and ``Histogram`` classes now
   support additional data formats (2297375).
-  ``ScrubberWidget`` now supports all figure formats (c317db4).
-  Allowed customizing legend positions on ``Bars`` Elements (5a12882).
-  Support for multiple colorbars on one axis (aac7b92).
-  ``.reindex`` on ``NdElement`` types now support converting between
   key and value dimensions allowing more powerful conversions.
   (03ac3ce)
-  Improved support for casting between ``Element`` types (cdaab4e,
   b2ad91b, ce7fe2d, 865b4d5).
-  The ``%%opts`` cell magic may now be used multiple times in the same
   cell (2a77fd0)
-  Matplotlib rcParams can now be set correctly per figure (751210f).
-  Improved ``OptionTree`` repr which now works with eval (2f824c1).
-  Refactor of rendering system and IPython extension to allow easy
   swapping of plotting backend (#141)
-  Large plotting optimization by computing tight ``bbox_inches`` once
   (e34e339).
-  Widgets now cache frames in the DOM, avoiding flickering in some
   browsers and make use of jinja2 template inheritance. (fc7dd2b)
-  Calling a HoloViews object without arguments now clears any
   associated custom styles. (9e8c343)

API Changes

-  Renamed key\_dimensions and value\_dimensions to kdims and vdims
   respectively, while providing backward compatibility for passing and
   accessing the long names (8feb7d2).
-  Combined x/y/zticker plot options into x/y/zticks parameters which
   now accept an explicit number of ticks, an explicit list of tick
   positions (and labels), and a Matplotlib tick locator.
-  Changed backend options in %output magic, ``nbagg`` and ``d3`` are
   now modes of the Matplotlib backend and can be selected with
   ``backend-'matplotlib:nbagg'`` and ``backend-'matplotlib:mpld3'``
   respectively. The 'd3' and 'nbagg' options remain supported but will
   be deprecated in future.
-  Customizations should no longer be applied directly to
   ``Store.options``; the ``Store.options(backend-'matplotlib')`` object
   should be customized instead. There is no longer a need to call the
   deprecated ``Store.register_plots`` method.
