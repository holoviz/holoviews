   `#620 <https://github.com/ioam/holoviews/issues/620>`__).

Version 1.4.3
-------------

A minor bugfix release to patch a number of small but important issues.

Fixes and improvements:

-  Added a `DynamicMap
   Tutorial <http://holoviews.org/Tutorials/Dynamic_Map.html>`__ to
   explain how to explore very large or continuous parameter spaces in
   HoloViews (`PR
   #470 <https://github.com/ioam/holoviews/issues/470>`__).
-  Various fixes and improvements for DynamicMaps including slicing (`PR
   #488 <https://github.com/ioam/holoviews/issues/488>`__) and
   validation (`PR
   #483 <https://github.com/ioam/holoviews/issues/478>`__) and
   serialization (`PR
   #483 <https://github.com/ioam/holoviews/issues/478>`__)
-  Widgets containing Matplotlib plots now display the first frame from
   cache providing at least the initial frame when exporting DynamicMaps
   (`PR #486 <https://github.com/ioam/holoviews/issues/483>`__)
-  Fixed plotting Bokeh plots using widgets in live mode, after changes
   introduced in latest Bokeh version (commit
   `1b87c91e9 <https://github.com/ioam/holoviews/commit/1b87c91e9e7cf35b267344ccd4a2fa91dd052890>`__).
-  Fixed issue in coloring Point/Scatter objects by values (`Issue

Backwards compatibility:

-  The behavior of the ``scaling_factor`` on Point and Scatter plots has
   changed now simply multiplying ``area`` or ``width`` (as defined by
   the ``scaling_method``). To disable scaling points by a dimension set
   ``size_index-None``.
-  Removed hooks to display 3D Elements using the ``BokehMPLRawWrapper``
   in Bokeh (`PR #477 <https://github.com/ioam/holoviews/pull/477>`__)

Version 1.4.1
-------------

Over the past two weeks since the 1.4 release, we have implemented
several important bug fixes and have made several usability
improvements.

New features:

-  Improved help system. It is now possible to recursively list all the
   applicable documentation for a composite object. In addition, the
   documentation may now be filtered using a regular expression pattern.
   (`PR #370 <https://github.com/ioam/holoviews/pull/370>`__)
-  HoloViews now supports multiple active display hooks making it easier
   to use nbconvert. For instance, PNG data will be embedded in the
   notebook if the argument display\_formats-['html','png'] is supplied
   to the notebook\_extension. (`PR
   #355 <https://github.com/ioam/holoviews/pull/355>`__)
-  Improvements to the display of DynamicMaps as well as many new
   improvements to the Bokeh backend including better VLines/HLines and
   support for the Bars element. (`PR
   #367 <https://github.com/ioam/holoviews/pull/367>`__ , `PR
   #362 <https://github.com/ioam/holoviews/pull/362>`__, `PR
   #339 <https://github.com/ioam/holoviews/pull/339>`__).
-  New Spikes and BoxWhisker elements suitable for representing
   distributions as a sequence of lines or as a box-and-whisker plot.
   (`PR #346 <https://github.com/ioam/holoviews/pull/346>`__, `PR
   #339 <https://github.com/ioam/holoviews/pull/339>`__)
-  Improvements to the notebook\_extension. For instance, executing
   hv.notebook\_extension('bokeh') will now load BokehJS and
   automatically activate the Bokeh backend (if available).
-  Significant performance improvements when using the groupby operation
   on HoloMaps and when working with highly nested datastructures. (`PR
   #349 <https://github.com/ioam/holoviews/pull/349>`__, `PR
   #359 <https://github.com/ioam/holoviews/pull/359>`__)

Notable bug fixes:

-  DynamicMaps are now properly integrated into the style system and can
   be customized in the same way as HoloMaps. (`PR
   #368 <https://github.com/ioam/holoviews/pull/368>`__)
-  Widgets now work correctly when unicode is used in the dimension
   labels and values (`PR
   #376 <https://github.com/ioam/holoviews/pull/376>`__).

Version 1.4.0
-------------

Over the past few months we have added several major new features and
with the help of our users have been able to address a number of bugs
and inconsistencies. We have closed 57 issues and added over 1100 new
commits.

Major new features:

-  Data API: The new data API brings an extensible system of to add new
   data interfaces to column based Element types. These interfaces allow
   applying powerful operations on the data independently of the data
   format. The currently supported datatypes include NumPy, pandas
   dataframes and a simple dictionary format. (`PR
   #284 <https://github.com/ioam/holoviews/pull/284>`__)
-  Backend API: In this release we completely refactored the rendering,
   plotting and IPython display system to make it easy to add new
   plotting backends. Data may be styled and pickled for each backend
   independently and renderers now support exporting all plotting data
   including widgets as standalone HTML files or with separate JSON
   data.
-  Bokeh backend: The first new plotting backend added via the new
   backend API. Bokeh plots allow for much faster plotting and greater
   interactivity. Supports most Element types and layouts and provides
   facilities for sharing axes across plots and linked brushing across
   plots. (`PR #250 <https://github.com/ioam/holoviews/pull/250>`__)
-  DynamicMap: The new DynamicMap class allows HoloMap data to be
   generated on-the-fly while running a Jupyter IPython notebook kernel.
   Allows visualization of unbounded data streams and smooth exploration
   of large continuous parameter spaces. (`PR
   #278 <https://github.com/ioam/holoviews/pull/278>`__)

Other features:

-  Easy definition of custom aliases for group, label and Dimension
   names, allowing easier use of LaTeX.
-  New Trisurface and QuadMesh elements.
-  Widgets now allow expressing hierarchical relationships between
   dimensions.
-  Added GridMatrix container for heterogeneous Elements and gridmatrix
   operation to generate scatter matrix showing relationship between
   dimensions.
-  Filled contour regions can now be generated using the contours
   operation.
-  Consistent indexing semantics for all Elements and support for
   boolean indexing for Columns and NdMapping types.
-  New hv.notebook\_extension function offers a more flexible
   alternative to %load\_ext, e.g. for loading other extensions
   hv.notebook\_extension(bokeh-True).

Experimental features:

-  Bokeh callbacks allow adding interactivity by communicating between
   BokehJS tools and the IPython kernel, e.g. allowing downsampling
   based on the zoom level.

Notable bug fixes:

-  Major speedup rendering large HoloMaps (~ 2-3 times faster).
-  Colorbars now consistent for all plot configurations.
-  Style pickling now works correctly.

API Changes:

-  Dimension formatter parameter now deprecated in favor of
   value\_format.
-  Types of Chart and Table Element data now dependent on selected
   interface.
-  DFrame conversion interface deprecated in favor of Columns pandas
   interface.

Version 1.3.1
-------------

Minor bugfix release to address a number of issues that weren't caught
in time for the 1.3.0 release with the addition of a small number of
features:

Features:

-  Introduced new ``Spread`` element to plot errors and confidence
   intervals (30d3184).
-  ``ErrorBars`` and ``Spread`` elements now allow most Chart
   constructor types (f013deb).

-  Fixed setting of fps option for MPLRenderer video output (c61b9df).
-  Fix for multiple and animated colorbars (5e1e4b5).
-  Fix to Chart slices starting or ending at zero (edd0039).

Version 1.3.0
-------------

Since the last release we closed over 34 issues and have made 380
commits mostly focused on fixing bugs, cleaning up the API and working
extensively on the plotting and rendering system to ensure HoloViews is
fully backend independent.

We'd again like to thank our growing user base for all their input,
which has helped us in making the API more understandable and fixing a
number of important bugs.

Highlights/Features:

-  Allowed display of data structures which do not match the recommended
   nesting hierarchy (67b28f3, fbd89c3).
-  Dimensions now sanitized for ``.select``, ``.sample`` and ``.reduce``
   calls (6685633, 00b5a66).
-  Added ``holoviews.ipython.display`` function to render (and display)
   any HoloViews object, useful for IPython interact widgets (0fa49cd).
-  Table column widths now adapt to cell contents (be90a54).
-  Defaulting to Matplotlib ticking behavior (62e1e58).
-  Allowed specifying fixed figure sizes to Matplotlib via
   ``fig_inches`` tuples using (width, None) and (None, height) formats
   (632facd).
-  Constructors of ``Chart``, ``Path`` and ``Histogram`` classes now
   support additional data formats (2297375).
-  ``ScrubberWidget`` now supports all figure formats (c317db4).
-  Allowed customizing legend positions on ``Bars`` Elements (5a12882).
-  Support for multiple colorbars on one axis (aac7b92).
-  ``.reindex`` on ``NdElement`` types now support converting between
   key and value dimensions allowing more powerful conversions.
   (03ac3ce)
-  Improved support for casting between ``Element`` types (cdaab4e,
   b2ad91b, ce7fe2d, 865b4d5).
-  The ``%%opts`` cell magic may now be used multiple times in the same
   cell (2a77fd0)
-  Matplotlib rcParams can now be set correctly per figure (751210f).
-  Improved ``OptionTree`` repr which now works with eval (2f824c1).
-  Refactor of rendering system and IPython extension to allow easy
   swapping of plotting backend (#141)
-  Large plotting optimization by computing tight ``bbox_inches`` once
   (e34e339).
-  Widgets now cache frames in the DOM, avoiding flickering in some
   browsers and make use of jinja2 template inheritance. (fc7dd2b)
-  Calling a HoloViews object without arguments now clears any
   associated custom styles. (9e8c343)

API Changes

-  Renamed key\_dimensions and value\_dimensions to kdims and vdims
   respectively, while providing backward compatibility for passing and
   accessing the long names (8feb7d2).
-  Combined x/y/zticker plot options into x/y/zticks parameters which
   now accept an explicit number of ticks, an explicit list of tick
   positions (and labels), and a Matplotlib tick locator.
-  Changed backend options in %output magic, ``nbagg`` and ``d3`` are
   now modes of the Matplotlib backend and can be selected with
   ``backend-'matplotlib:nbagg'`` and ``backend-'matplotlib:mpld3'``
   respectively. The 'd3' and 'nbagg' options remain supported but will
   be deprecated in future.
-  Customizations should no longer be applied directly to
   ``Store.options``; the ``Store.options(backend-'matplotlib')`` object
   should be customized instead. There is no longer a need to call the
   deprecated ``Store.register_plots`` method.
