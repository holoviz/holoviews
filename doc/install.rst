Installing HoloViews
====================

The quickest and easiest way to get the latest version of all the
recommended packages for working with HoloViews on Linux, Windows, or
Mac systems is via the
`conda <https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/>`_ command provided by
the
`Anaconda <https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/>`_ or
`Miniconda <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html>`_ scientific
Python distributions::

  conda install -c pyviz holoviews

This recommended installation includes the default `Matplotlib
<http://matplotlib.org>`_ plotting library backend, the
more interactive `Bokeh <http://bokeh.pydata.org>`_ plotting library
backend, and the `Jupyter Notebook <http://jupyter.org>`_.

A similar set of packages can be installed using ``pip``, if that
command is available on your system::

  pip install "holoviews[recommended]"

``pip`` also supports other installation options, including a minimal
install of only the packages necessary to generate and manipulate
HoloViews objects without visualization::

  pip install holoviews

This minimal install includes only three required libraries `Param
<https://param.holoviz.org/>`_, `Numpy <https://numpy.org>`_ and,
`pandas <https://pandas.pydata.org/>`_, which makes it very easy to
integrate HoloViews into your workflow or as part of another project.

Alternatively, you can ask ``pip`` to install a larger set of
packages that provide additional functionality in HoloViews::

  pip install "holoviews[examples]"

This option installs all the required and recommended packages, in
addition to all all libraries required for running all the examples.

Lastly, to get *everything* including the test dependencies, you can use::

  pip install "holoviews[all]"

Between releases, development snapshots are made available on conda and
can be installed using::

  conda install -c pyviz/label/dev holoviews

To get the very latest development version using ``pip``, you can use::

  pip install git+https://github.com/holoviz/holoviews.git

The alternative approach using git archive (e.g ``pip install
https://github.com/holoviz/holoviews/archive/master.zip``) is *not*
recommended as you will have incomplete version strings.

Anyone interested in following development can get the very latest
version by cloning the git repository::

  git clone https://github.com/holoviz/holoviews.git

To make this code available for import you then need to run::

  python setup.py develop

And you can then update holoviews at any time to the latest version by
running::

  git pull

Once you've installed HoloViews, you can get started by launching
Jupyter Notebook::

  jupyter notebook

To work with JupyterLab>2.0 you won't need to install anything else,
however for older versions you should also install the PyViz
extension::

  jupyter labextension install @pyviz/jupyterlab_pyviz

Once you have installed JupyterLab and the extension launch it with::

  jupyter lab

Now that you are set up you can get a copy of all the examples shown
on this website::

    holoviews --install-examples
    cd holoviews-examples
