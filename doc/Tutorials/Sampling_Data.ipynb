    "As explained in the [Composing Data](Composing_Data.ipynb) and [Containers](Containers.ipynb) tutorials, HoloViews allows you to build up hierarchical containers that express the natural relationships between your data items, in whatever multidimensional space best characterizes your application domain.  Once your data is in such containers, individual visualizations are then made by choosing subregions of this multidimensional space, either smaller numeric ranges (as in cropping of photographic images), or lower-dimensional subsets (as in selecting frames from a movie, or a specific movie from a large library), or both (as in selecting a cropped version of a frame from a specific movie from a large library).  \n",

    "| **sample**     | e.sample(y=5.5),<br>e.sample((3,3)) |  Selecting one or more regularly spaced data values, returning a new type of Element\n",
    "| **select**     | e.select(y=5.5),<br>e.select(y=(3,5.5)) | More verbose notation covering all supporting slice and index operations by dimension name.\n",
    "\n",
    "These operations are all concerned with selecting some subset of your data values, without combining across data values (e.g. averaging) or otherwise transforming your actual data. In the [Columnar Data](Columnar_Data.ipynb) tutorial we will look at other operations on the data that reduce, summarize, or transform the data in other ways, rather than selections as covered here.\n",
