If this is your first contact with HoloViews, you may want to start by looking at our [showcase](Showcase.ipynb) to get a good idea of what can be achieved with HoloViews.  If this introduction does not cover the type of visualizations you need, you should check out our [Elements](Elements.ipynb) and [Containers](Containers.ipynb) components to see what else is available."

   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "HoloViews allows you to collect and annotate your data in a way that reveals it naturally, with a minimum of effort needed for you to see your data as it actually *is*.  HoloViews is not a plotting library -- it connects your data to plotting code implemented in other packages, such as [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) or [Bokeh](http://bokeh.pydata.org).  HoloViews is also not primarily a mass storage or archival data format like [HDF5](http://www.h5py.org/) -- it is designed to package your data to make it maximally visualizable and viewable interactively.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you supply just enough additional information to the data of interest, HoloViews allows you to store, index, slice, analyze, reduce, compose, display, and animate your data as naturally as possible.  HoloViews makes your numerical data come alive, revealing itself easily and without extensive coding. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few of the things HoloViews allows you to associate with your data:\n",
    "\n",
    "* ***The [Element](Elements) type***. This encapsulates your data and is the most fundamental indicator of how your data can be analyzed and displayed. For instance, if you wrap a 2D numpy array in a ``Image`` it will be displayed as an image with a colormap by default, a ``Curve`` will be presented as a line plot on an axis, and so on.  Once your data has been encapsulated in an ``Element`` object, other ``Elements`` can easily be created from it, such as obtaining a ``Curve`` by taking a cross-section of a ``Image``.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* ***Dimensions of your data***. The key dimensions (``kdims``) describe how your data can be indexed. The value dimensions (``vdims``) describe what the resulting indexed data represents. A numerical ``Dimension`` can have a name, type, range, and unit. This information allows HoloViews to rescale and label axes and allows HoloViews be smart in how it processes your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* ***The multi-dimensional space in which your data resides***. This may be space as we normally think of it (in *x*, *y*, and *z* coordinates). It may be the spatial position of one component relative to another. Or it may be an entirely abstract space, such as a parameter space or a list of experiments done on different days.  Whatever multi-dimensional space characterizes how one chunk of your data relates to another chunk, you can embed your data in that space easily, sparsely populating whatever region of that space you want to analyze.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* ***How your data should be grouped for display***. In short, how you want your data to be organized for visualization. If you have a collection of points that was computed from an image, you can easily overlay your points over the image. As a result you have something that both displays sensibly, and is grouped together in a semantically meaningful way.\n",
    "\n",
    "HoloViews can display your data even if it knows only the [Element](Elements.ipynb) type, \n",
    "which lets HoloViews stay out your way when initially exploring your data, offering immediate feedback with reasonable default visualizations. As your analysis becomes more complex and your research progresses, you may offer more of the useful metadata above so that HoloViews will automatically improve your displayed figures accordingly.  Throughout, all you need to supply is this metadata plus optional and separate plotting hints (such as choosing specific colors if you like), rather than having to write cumbersome code to put figures together or having to paste bits together manually in an external drawing or plotting program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the HoloViews data components have only minimal required dependencies (Numpy and Param, both with no required dependencies of their own).  This data format can thus be integrated directly into your research or development code, for maximum convenience and flexibility (see e.g. the [ImaGen](http://ioam.github.io/imagen) library for an example).  Plotting implementations are currently provided for matplotlib and Bokeh, and other plotting packages could be used for the same data in the future if needed.  Similarly, HoloViews provides strong support for the [IPython/Jupyter notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html) interface, and we recommend using the notebook for building [reproducible yet interactive workflows](Exporting.ipynb), but none of the components require IPython either.  Thus HoloViews is designed to fit into your existing workflow, without adding complicated dependencies."

But the ``RGB`` object itself does not have any connection to the plotting library, and stores no data about the plot, just its own data, which is sufficient for the external plotting routines to visualize the data usefully and meaningfully.
