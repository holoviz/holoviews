    "The [Containers](Containers.ipynb) Tutorial introduced the [HoloMap](Containers.ipynb#HoloMap), a core HoloViews data structure that allows easy exploration of parameter spaces. The essence of a HoloMap is that it contains a collection of [Elements](Elements.ipynb) (e.g. Images and Curves) that you can easily select and visualize.\n",
    "\n",
    "HoloMaps hold fully constructed Elements at specifically sampled points in a multidimensional space. Although HoloMaps are useful for exploring high-dimensional parameter spaces, they can very quickly consume huge amounts of memory to store all these Elements. For instance, a hundred samples along four orthogonal dimensions would need a HoloMap containing a hundred *million* Elements, each of which could be a substantial object that takes time to create and costs memory to store. Thus ``HoloMaps`` have some clear limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "* HoloMaps may require the generation of millions of Elements before the first element can be viewed.\n",
    "* HoloMaps can easily exhaust all the memory available to Python.\n",
    "* HoloMaps can even more easily exhaust all the memory in the browser when displayed.\n",
    "* Static export of a notebook containing HoloMaps can result in impractically large HTML files.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ``DynamicMap`` addresses these issues by computing and displaying elements dynamically, allowing exploration of much larger datasets:\n",
    "\n",
    "* DynamicMaps generate elements on the fly, allowing the process of exploration to begin immediately.\n",
    "* DynamicMaps do not require fixed sampling, allowing exploration of parameters with arbitrary resolution.\n",
    "* DynamicMaps are lazy in the sense they only compute only as much data as the user wishes to explore.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, these advantages come with some limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "* DynamicMaps require a live notebook server and cannot be fully exported to static HTML.\n",
    "* DynamicMaps store only a portion of the underlying data, in the form of an Element cache, which reduces the utility of pickling a DynamicMap.\n",
    "* DynamicMaps (and particularly their element caches) are typically stateful (with values that depend on patterns of user interaction), which can make them more difficult to reason about.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to handle the various situations in which one might want to use a ``DynamicMap``, ``DynamicMaps`` can be defined in various \"modes\" that will be each described separately below:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [**Bounded mode:**](#BoundedMode) All dimension ranges specified, allowing exploration within the ranges (i.e., within a bounded region of the multidimensional parameter space).\n",
    "* [**Sampled mode:**](#SampledMode) Some dimension ranges left unspecified, making the ``DynamicMap`` not viewable directly, but useful in combination with other objects or for later specifying samples or ranges.\n",
    "* [**Open mode:**](#OpenMode) Dimension ranges not specified, with new elements created on request using a generator.\n",
    "* [**Counter mode:**](#CounterMode) Dimension ranges not specified, with new elements created based on a shared counter state, e.g. from a simulation.\n",

By grouping over specific dimensions that define a fixed sampling via the Dimension values parameter, the DynamicMap can be viewed as a ``GridSpace``, ``NdLayout``, or ``NdOverlay``. If a dimension specifies only a continuous range it can't be grouped over, but it may still be explored using the widgets. This means we can plot partial or completely discretized views of a parameter space easily.\n",

However, once a consistent scheme is configured, the callable in each ``DynamicMap`` can specify the desired simulation time. If the requested simulation time is the same as the current simulation time, nothing needs to happen. Otherwise, the simulator can be run forward by the requested amount.  In this way, HoloViews can provide a rich graphical interface for controlling and visualizing an external simulator, with very little code required."
