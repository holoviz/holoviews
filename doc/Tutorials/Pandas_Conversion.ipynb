    "Pandas is one of the most popular Python libraries providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools.  It also provides I/O interfaces to store and load your data in a variety of formats, including CSV files, JSON, Python pickles, and even databases. In other words it makes loading data, munging data, and even complex data analysis tasks a breeze.\n",

    "The first thing to understand when working with pandas dataframes in HoloViews is how data is indexed. Pandas dataframes are structured as tables with any number of columns and indexes. HoloViews, on the other hand, deals with Dimensions. HoloViews container objects such as [HoloMap](https://ioam.github.io/holoviews/Tutorials/Containers.html#HoloMap), [NdLayout](https://holoviews.org/Tutorials/Containers.html#NdLayout), [GridSpace](https://holoviews.org/Tutorials/Containers.html#GridSpace) and [NdOverlay](https://holoviews.org/Tutorials/Containers.html#NdOverlay) have kdims, which provide metadata about the data along that dimension and how they can be sliced. [Element](https://holoviews.org/Tutorials/Elements.html) objects, on the other hand, have both key dimensions (``kdims``) and value dimensions (``vdims``). The kdims of a HoloViews datastructure represent the position, bin or category along a particular dimension, while the value dimensions usually represent some continuous variable.\n",
