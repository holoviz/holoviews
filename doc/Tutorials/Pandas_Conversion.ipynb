      "The first thing to understand when working with pandas dataframes in HoloViews is how data is indexed. Pandas dataframes are structured as tables with any number of columns and indexes. HoloViews on the other hand deals with Dimensions. HoloViews container objects such as the [HoloMap](https://ioam.github.io/holoviews/Tutorials/Containers.html#HoloMap), [NdLayout](https://ioam.github.io/holoviews/Tutorials/Containers.html#NdLayout), [GridSpace](https://ioam.github.io/holoviews/Tutorials/Containers.html#GridSpace) and [NdOverlay](https://ioam.github.io/holoviews/Tutorials/Containers.html#NdOverlay) have key_dimensions, which provide metadata about the data along that dimension and how they can be sliced. [Element](https://ioam.github.io/holoviews/Tutorials/Elements.html) objects on the other hand have both key_dimensions and value_dimensions. The difference between key_dimensions and value_dimensions in HoloViews is that the former may be sliced and indexed while the latter merely provide a description about the values along that Dimension.\n",
