The object itself is otherwise unchanged, but then if that object is later used in another container, etc. it will retain its ID and therefore its customization.

This approach lets HoloViews keep track of any customizations you want to make, without ever affecting your actual data objects.\n",

Specifically, it assigns a new ID number to the object returned from this cell, and makes a new ``OptionTree`` containing the options for that ID number.\n",

There is also an even further abbreviated syntax, because the special bracket types alone are enough to indicate which category of option is specified:\n",

Of course, you will still need to consult the full ``holoviews.help`` documentation (described above) to see the type, allowable values, and documentation for each option, but the tab completion should at least get you started and is great for helping you remember the list of options and see which options are available.\n",
