    A Link defines some connection between a source and target object

    allows defining callbacks in response to some change or event on
    the source object, however, unlike a Stream, it does not transfer
    data and make it available to user defined subscribers. Instead
    a Link directly causes some action to occur on the target, for JS
    based backends this usually means that a corresponding JS callback
    will effect some change on the target in response to a change on
    the source.

    A Link must define a source object which is what triggers events,
    but must not define a target. It is also possible to define bi-
    directional links between the source and target object.
