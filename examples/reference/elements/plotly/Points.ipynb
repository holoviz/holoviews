    "**Note**: Although the  ``Scatter`` element is superficially similar to the [``Points``](./Points.ipynb) element (they can generate plots that look identical), the two element types are semantically quite different. The fundamental difference is that [Scatter](./Scatter.ipynb) is used to visualize data where the *y* variable is *dependent*, unlike ``Points``. This semantic difference also explains why the histogram generated by the ``hist`` call above visualizes the distribution of a different dimension than it does for [``Scatter``](./Scatter.ipynb) (because here *z*, not *y*, is the first ``vdim``).\n",
