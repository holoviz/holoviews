    "**Note**: Although the  ``Scatter`` element is superficially similar to the [``Points``](./Points.ipynb) element (they can generate plots that look identical), the two element types are semantically quite different: Unlike ``Scatter``, ``Points`` are used to visualize data where the *y* variable is *independent*. This semantic difference also explains why the histogram generated by the ``hist`` call above visualizes the distribution of a different dimension than it does for [``Points``](./Points.ipynb) (because here *y*, not *z*, is the first ``vdim``).\n",

    "This difference means that ``Scatter`` elements can most naturally overlay with other elements that express dependent relationships between the *x* and *y* axes in two-dimensional space, such as the ``Chart`` types like [``Curve``](./Curve.ipynb). Conversely, ``Points`` elements either capture *(x,y)* spatial locations or they express a dependent relationship between an *(x,y)* location and some other dimension (expressed as point size, color, etc.), and thus they can most naturally overlay with [``Raster``](./Raster.ipynb) types like [``Image``](./Image.ipynb).\n",
