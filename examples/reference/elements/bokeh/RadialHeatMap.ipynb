    "**Design**: In order model the above ideas, we decide to assign days with hourly split to the *radial segments* and week of year to the *annulars*. This will allow to detect daily/hourly periodicity and weekly trends. To get you more familiar with the mapping of segemnts and annulars, take a look at the following radial heatmap:"

    "- **Remove annular ticks**: The information about week of year is not very important. Therefore, we hide it via `yticks=None`.\n",
    "- **Custom segment ticks**: Right now, segment labels are given via day and hour. We don't need hourly information and we want every day to be labeled. We can use a tuple here which will be passed to `xticks=(\"Friday\", ..., \"Thursday\")`\n",
    "- **Add segment markers**: Moreover, we want to aid the viewer in distingushing each day more clearly. Hence, we can provide marker lines via `xmarks=7`.\n",
    "- **Rotate heatmap**: The week starts with Monday and ends with Sunday. Accordingly, we want to rotate the plot to have Sunday and Monday be at the top. This can be done via `start_angle=np.pi*19/14`. The default order is defined by the global sort order which is present in the data. The default starting angle is at 12 o'clock.\n",
