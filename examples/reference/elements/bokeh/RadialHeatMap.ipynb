First, taxi pickup counts are high between 7-9am and 5-10pm during weekdays which correspond to typical start and end business hours. In contrast, during weekends, there is not much going on until 11am. Second, Friday and Saterday nights clearly stand out with the highest pickup densities as expected. Third, public holidays can be easily identified. For example, taxi pickup counts are comparetively low for around Christmas and Thanksgiving.\n",

    "2. ``separate_nth_segment``: Separation lines were added to distinguish each weakday from one another more clearly.\n",
