    "Image represents a regularly sampled 2D grid of an underlying [continuous space](Continuous_Coordinates.ipynb) of intensity values, which will be colormapped on plotting. The grid of intensity values may be specified as a ``NxM`` sized array of values along with a bounds, but it may also be defined through explicit and regularly spaced x/y-coordinate arrays of shape ``M`` and ``N`` respectively. The two most basic supported constructors of an Image therefore include:\n",

See the [Gridded Datasets](../../../user_guide/08-Gridded_Datasets.ipynb) user guide for all the other accepted data formats."
