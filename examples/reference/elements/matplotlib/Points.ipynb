    "**Note**: Although the  ``Scatter`` element is superficially similar to the [``Points``](./Points.ipynb) element (they can generate plots that look identical), the two element types are semantically quite different. The fundamental difference is that [``Points``](./Points.ipynb) are used to visualize data where the *y* variable is *dependent*. This semantic difference also explains why the histogram generated by ``hist`` call above visualizes the distribution of a different dimension than it does for [``Scatter``](./Scatter.ipynb).\n",
