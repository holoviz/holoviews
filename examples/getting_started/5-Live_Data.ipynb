Perhaps the data doesn't even exist yet: it may be the result of some computation yet to be performed or the outcome of some live process with the corresponding measurement not yet made.\n",

    "``DynamicMap`` and ``Streams`` allow specification of exciting, dynamic visualizations that let you build full-featured interactive applications and simulations with very little code (particularly when combined with a declarative widget library like [ParamNB](https://github.com/ioam/paramnb) or [ParamBokeh](https://github.com/ioam/parambokeh)). The way these dynamic visualizations work is that HoloViews runs JavaScript in your browser, which then communicates with a running Python server process that may be running in the Jupyter notebook server or in the [Bokeh server](http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/server.html). This Python process may be running locally on your machine or on some remote internet or local-network server. Regardless of where it is running, this Python process executes the callback you supply to ``DynamicMap``, allowing HoloViews to update your visualization whenever the parameters change.\n",

    "This architecture is powerful and fully general, as you can always make static content in memory into dynamic output generated by a function (see the [User Guide](../user_guide/06-Live_Data.ipynb) to learn more). Using live data is not always recommended, however, because using purely static content also has some important advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reasons to use live data\n",
    "\n",
    "* Your data is inherently coming from a live source and your visualization needs to reflect this in real time.\n",
    "* You wish to explore a large parameter space and statically sampling this space adequately is prohibitive in memory or computation time.\n",
    "* Your data is too big to fit in memory and you only need to explore a portion of it that you can stream in from disk.\n",
    "* You want an open-ended visualization that keeps updating indefinitely.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reasons to use static data\n",
    "\n",
    "* You wish to archive or record your visualization in such a way that it exists independently of code execution in a potentially changing codebase.\n",
    "* You wish to share visualizations in a static HTML file that does not require running a live server (e.g a file that can be e-mailed and immediately viewed or placed on an HTML server).\n",
    "\n",
    "The general recommendation is to visualize your data with ``HoloMap`` (as in the introduction to this guide) when you have a small amount of data (typically a few megabytes) that can be quickly computed and can reasonably be embedded into an HTML file. Otherwise, you can use ``DynamicMap`` that you can sample from to generate a ``HoloMap`` from when you wish to share your results (see the [user guide](../user_guide/06-Live_Data.ipynb) for more information on how to turn your ``DynamicMap`` objects into ``HoloMap``s).\n",
