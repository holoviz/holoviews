    "The DynamicMap together with the streams system allow specification of exciting, dynamic visualizations and interactions. The way it works is that HoloViews runs JavaScript in your browser which then communicates with a running Python server process that may be running in the Jupyter notebook server or in the [Bokeh server]. This Python process may be running locally on your machine or some remote server either online or somewhere else on your local network. Regardless of where it is running, this Python process executes the callback you supply to ``DynamicMap`` allowing HoloViews to update your visualization whenever the parameters change.\n",
    "\n",

Using live data is not always recommended, however, as using purely static content also has some important advantages.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reasons to use live data\n",
    "\n",
    "* Your data is inherently coming from a live source and your visualization needs to reflect this in real time.\n",
    "* You wish to explore a large parameter space and statically sampling this space adequately is prohibitive in memory or computation time.\n",
    "* Your data is too big to fit in memory and you only need to explore a portion of it that you can stream in from disk\n",
    "* You want an open-ended visualization that keeps updating indefinitely.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reasons to use static data\n",
    "\n",
    "* You wish to archive or record your visualization in such a way that they exist independently of code execution in a potentially changing codebase.\n",
    "* You wish to share visualizations in a static HTML file that does not require running a live server (e.g a file that can be e-mailed and immediately viewed or placed on an HTML server).\n",
    "\n",
    "The general recommendation is to visualize your data with ``HoloMap`` when you have a small amount of data (typically a few megabytes) that can be quickly computed and can reasonably be embedded into an HTML file. Otherwise, you can use ``DynamicMap`` that you can sample from to generate a ``HoloMap`` from when you wish to share your results (see the [User Guide] for more information on how to turn your ``DynamicMap`` objects into ``HoloMap``s)."
