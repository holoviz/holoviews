    "For a recent talk in my department I talked a little bit about agent based modeling and in the process I came across the simple but quite interesting SIR model in epidemiology. The inspiration for this post was Simon Dobson's post on [Epidemic spreading processes](http://www.simondobson.org/complex-networks-complex-processes/epidemic-spreading.html), which will provide a much more detailed scientific background and take you through some of the code step by step. However as a brief introduction\n",

    "In this blog post I'll primarily look at how we can quickly create complex visualization about this model using HoloViews. In the process I'll look at some predictions this model can make about herd immunity but won't be giving it any rigorous scientific treatment."
