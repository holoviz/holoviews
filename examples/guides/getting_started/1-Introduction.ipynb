    "\n",
    "This 'Getting Started' guide aims to get you using HoloViews productively as quickly as possible. It is designed as an entrypoint for new users that will introduce the core concepts necessary to get you working productively with your own data. We recommend reading this guide in order if you wish to get an overview of what is offered by HoloViews. For detailed documentation, please consult our [User Guide] which we will link to from the appropriate sections of this guide.\n",

    "# Why HoloViews?\n",
    "\n",
    "HoloViews is a BSD licensed package used for data analysis and visualization for Python 2 and 3. There are plenty of excellent tools available for Python already such as numpy, pandas and xarray for raw data processing as well as some excellent plotting libraries such as matplotlib, bokeh and plotly. So why is there a need for another plotting library?\n",
    "\n",
    "As will be made clear over the course of this guide, HoloViews takes a distinct approach to visualization which is quite distinct from the traditional plotting paradigm. Instead of building plots and writing plotting code, you describe your data with a small amount of semantic information. This then enables immediate, automatic visualization that can be effortlessly requested at any time as your data evolves. Without requiring any traditional plotting code, HoloViews brings your data to life with your favorite plotting library, whether it is matplotlib, bokeh or plotly.\n",
    "\n",
    "HoloViews is data-centric while traditional plotting libraries are visualization-centric. Instead of a 'Data Visualization' library that visualizes data at a snapshot in time, HoloViews is about empowering your data with the power of self-visualization as it is explored and transformed. For this reason, HoloViews can be viewed as a 'Visualization Data' library and by the end of this guide this distinction should be clear.\n",

    "We will now introduce HoloViews and demonstrate some of its most compelling features using real data relating to transportation in Manhattan, New York. First lets run some imports to make [numpy] and [pandas] accessible for loading our transportation data. We will start with a table of subway station information loaded from a CSV file with pandas and later on in this section, we will load some data relating to taxi dropoffs using numpy:"
