    "# Interactive Hover for Big Data\n",
    "When visualizing large datasets with [Datashader](https://datashader.org/), you can easily identify macro level patterns. However, the aggregation process that converts the data into an image can make it difficult to examine individual data points, especially if they occupy the same pixel. This sets up a challenge: how do you explore individual data points without sacrificing the benefits of aggregation?\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this problem, HoloViews offers the `selector` keyword, which makes it possible for the hover tooltip to include information about the underlying data points when using a Datashader operation (`rasterize` or `datashade`).\n",
    "\n",
    "The `selector` mechanism performantly retrieves the specific details on the server side without having to search through the entire dataset or having to send all the data to the browser. This allows users working with large datasets to detect big picture patterns while also accessing information about individual points.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to use `selector`, which creates a dynamic hover tool that keeps the interactive experience fast and smooth with very large datasets and makes it easier to explore and understand complex visualizations.\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{note}\n",
    "This notebook uses dynamic updates, which require running a live Jupyter or Bokeh server. When viewed statically, the plots will not update, you can zoom and pan, and hover information will not be available. \n",

    "This functionality requires Bokeh version 3.7 or greater.\n",

    "Let's start by creating a Points element with a DataFrame consisting of five datasets combined. Each of the datasets has a random x, y-coordinate based on a normal distribution centered at a specific (x, y) location, with varying standard deviations. The datasets—labeled `d1` through `d5`—represent different clusters:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `d1` is tightly clustered around (2, 2) with a small spread of 0.03,\n",
    "- `d2` is around (2, -2) with a wider spread of 0.10,\n",
    "- `d3` is around (-2, -2) with even more dispersion at 0.50,\n",
    "- `d4` is broadly spread around (-2, 2) with a standard deviation of 1.00,\n",
    "- and `d5` has the widest spread of 3.00 centered at the origin (0, 0).\n",
    "\n",
    "Each point also carries a `val` and `cat` column to identify its dataset and category. The total dataset contains 50,000 points, evenly split across the five distributions."

    "Since a `selector` is a subtype of `aggregator`, then why do we need a separate `selector` keyword? The answer is that very often, users will want to retain hover tooltip information about the **particular** data point within each pixel (e.g., with `min` or `max`) while aggregating the data to form an image using an approach that **combines** the overlapping data points (e.g., with `count` or `mean`). The following are valid `selector` operations that expose information for the **server-side hover tool** to collect about one of the underlying data points in a pixel:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `ds.min(<column>)`: Select the row with the minimum value for the column\n",
    "- `ds.max(<column>)`: Select the row with the maximum value for the column\n",
    "- `ds.first(<column>)`: Select the first value in the column\n",
    "- `ds.last(<column>)`: Select the last value in the column\n",
    "\n",

    "1. **Hover event**: When a user hovers over a plot, the pixel coordinates are sent to the server.\n",
    "2. **Data lookup**: The server uses these coordinates to look up the corresponding aggregated data from the pre-computed dataset.\n",
    "3. **Update display**: The hover information is updated and sent back to the front end to display detailed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "This design avoids sending all the raw data to the client and only transmits the necessary information on-demand. You can enable this by adding a `selector` to a `rasterize` or `datashade` operation. \n",
