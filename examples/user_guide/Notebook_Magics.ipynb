    "The [Applying Customizations](03-Applying_Customizations.ipynb) user guide describes the currently *recommended* way to customize your visualizations in HoloViews. Those mechanisms use standard Python syntax but they are not the only way to apply options as there is a much older approach for working with HoloViews that is specific to notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the start, HoloViews aimed to enable rapid exploration of data in Jupyter Notebooks. For this reason, when you load the HoloViews extension in a notebook, you also get a set of IPython magics. IPython magics use a syntax that is not standard Python and the HoloViews magics only apply in the notebook environment (and not the IPython terminal for instance).\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantages of the notebook magics are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* They allow tab-completion in the notebook environment (but so do the more recent option builders and `hv.output` mechanisms).\n",
    "* They allow very concise expression of options and settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, they also have some serious disadvantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "* They are not Python syntax which makes it difficult to use code written with magics in notebooks anywhere else. For instance, it makes it harder to use such code with [bokeh server](https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/reference/server.html) or [panel](https://panel.pyviz.org/).\n",
    "* They have their own special syntax which is very concise but also rather mysterious.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "These disadvantages means the magics can be bewildering to anyone unfamiliar with the IPython specific syntax and HoloViews itself, and are no longer recommended for these reasons. This user guide documents these magics to allow people to understand older notebooks using HoloViews and to help people update these old notebooks to use the recommended Python API."
