This enables powerful new ways of specifying HoloViews objects computed from existing data, allowing the construction of flexible data processing pipelines.

All operations are parameterized using the [param](https://github.com/holoviz/param) library which allows easy validation and documentation of the operation arguments.

    "Just as in the previous example, it is quite straight-forward to build a HoloMap containing results for different parameter values. Inside the ``_process()`` method, the given parameters can be accessed as ``self.p.<parameter-name>`` (note that ``self.<parameter_name>`` always contains the default value!). Since we did not specify the ``type_`` parameter, it defaulted to \"low-pass\".\n",

    "There are some peculiarities when applying operations to two-dimensional elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understanding the ``dimension_values()`` method: In principle, one could use ``element.data`` to access the element's data, however, since HoloViews can wrap a wide range of data formats, ``dimension_values()`` provides an API that lets you access the data without having to worry about the type of the data. The first parameter specifies the dimension to be returned. On a 2D element like an Image or Raster the first two dimensions reference the key dimensions, so passing an index of 0 or 1 will return the x- and y-axis values respectively. Any subsequent dimensions will be value dimensions, e.g. on an Image index value 2 will refer to the intensity values and on an RGB index values 2, 3, and 4 will return the Red, Green and Blue intensities instead. Setting ``expanded=False`` yields only the axis, while the default setting ``expanded=True`` returns a value for every pixel. Specifying ``flat=False`` means that the data's matrix shape will be preserved, which is what we need for this kind of filter.\n",
    "- ``Image`` and related classes come with convenient methods to convert between matrix indices and data coordinates and vice versa: ``matrix2sheet()`` and ``sheet2matrix()``. This is useful when searching for features such as peaks.\n",

    "A very powerful aspect of operations is the fact that they understand Holoviews data structures. This means it is very straight-forward to apply an operation to every element in a container. As an example, let's apply an additional high-pass filter to our HoloMap:"

    "## Benefits of using ``Operation``\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have seen some operations in action we can get some appreciation of what makes them useful. When working with data interactively we often end up applying a lot of ad-hoc data transforms, which provides maximum flexibility but is neither reproducible nor maintainable. Operations allow us to encapsulate analysis code using a well defined interface that is well suited for building complex analysis pipelines:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ``Operation`` parameters are well defined by declaring parameters on the class. These parameters can be easily documented and automatically carry out validation on the types and ranges of the inputs. These parameters are documented using ``hv.help``.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Both inputs and outputs of an operation are instantly visualizable, because the data **is** the visualization. This means you're not constantly context switching between data processing and visualization --- visualization comes for free as you build your data processing pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Operations understand HoloViews datastructures and can be immediately applied to any appropriate collection of elements, allowing you to evaluate the operation with permutations of parameter values. This flexibility makes it easy to assess the effect of operation parameters and their effect on your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. As we will discover in the [Data processing pipelines](./14-Data_Pipelines.ipynb) guide, operations can be applied lazily to build up complex deferred data-processing pipelines, which can aid your data exploration and drive interactive visualizations and dashboards.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Other types of operation\n",
    "\n",
    "As we have seen ``Operation`` is defined at the level of processing HoloViews elements or overlays of elements. In some situations, you may want to compute a new HoloViews datastructure from a number of elements contained in a structure other than an overlay, such as a HoloMap or a Layout. \n",
    "\n",
    "One such pattern is an operation that accepts and returns a ``HoloMap`` where each of the output element depends on all the data in the input ``HoloMap``. For situations such as these, subclassing ``Operation`` is not appropriate and we recommend defining your own function. These custom operation types won't automatically gain support for lazy pipelines as described in the [Data processing pipelines](./14-Data_Pipelines.ipynb) guide and how these custom operations are pipelined is left as a design decision for the user. Note that as long as these functions return simple elements or containers, their output can be used by subclasses of ``Operation`` as normal. \n",
    "\n",
    "What we *do* recommend is that you subclass from ``param.ParameterizedFunction`` so that you can declare well-documented and validated parameters, add a description of your operation with a class level docstring and gain automatic documentation support via ``hv.help``."
