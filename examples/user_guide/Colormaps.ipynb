    "As you can see, the colormap you choose can dramatically change how your data appears. A well-chosen colormap can help guide the user to notice the features of the data you want to highlight, while a poorly chosen colormap can completely obscure the data and lead to erroneous conclusions. E.g. the low levels of noise present in this data are very difficult to see in A and B, but they completely dominate the plot in C and are visible only at specific (presumably arbitrary) value levels that correspond to color transitions in D. Thus it is important to choose colormaps very carefully!\n",

In the above example, Matplotlib uses it as the colormap constructs the image, whereas a Bokeh version of the same plot would provide the colormap to the Bokeh JavaScript code running in the local web browser, which allows the user to control the colormap dynamically in some cases.\n",

    "As outlined in [Styling_Plots](Styling_Plots.ipynb), you can easily make your own custom colormaps, but it's quite difficult to ensure that a custom map is designed well, so it's generally best to choose an existing, well-tested colormap. Here we will show the many different types of colormaps available, discussing each category and how to use that type of map. The ones shown here are those that are available by name, if the corresponding provider has been installed. E.g. those labelled \"(bokeh)\" will only be available if Bokeh is installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of these colormaps will work best on *either* a light or a dark background, but not both. To faithfully and intuitively represent monotonically increasing values, you will generally want a colormap where the lowest values are similar in tone to the page background, and higher values become more perceptually salient compared to the page background. To let you match the colormap to the page, the maps listed below have a variant suffixed with `_r` (not shown), which is the same map but with the reverse order."

Useful as a counterpart and illustration of the role of lightness.\n",
