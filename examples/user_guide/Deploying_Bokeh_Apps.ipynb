    "## Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "HoloViews is an incredibly convenient way of working interactively and exploratively within a notebook or commandline context. However, once you have implemented a polished interactive dashboard or some other complex interactive visualization, you will often want to deploy it outside the notebook to share with others who may not be comfortable with the notebook interface. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the simplest case, to visualize some HoloViews container or element `obj`, you can export it to a standalone HTML file for sharing using the `save` method of the Bokeh renderer:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "hv.renderer('bokeh').save(obj,'out')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This command will generate a file `out.html` that you can put on any web server, email directly to colleagues, etc.; it is fully self-contained and does not require any Python server to be installed or running.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, a static approach like this cannot support any HoloViews object that uses DynamicMap (either directly or via operations that return DynamicMaps like `decimate`, `datashade`, and `rasterize`).  Anything with DynamicMap requires a live, running Python server to dynamically select and provide the data for the various parameters that can be selected by the user. Luckily, when you need a live Python process during the visualization, the [Bokeh server](http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/server.html) provides a very convenient way of deploying HoloViews plots and interactive dashboards in a scalable and flexible manner. The Bokeh server allows all the usual interactions that HoloViews lets you define and more including:\n",
    "\n",
    "* responding to plot events and tool interactions via [Linked Streams](./12-Custom_Interactivity.ipynb)\n",
    "* generating and interacting with plots via the usual widgets that HoloViews supports for HoloMap and DynamicMap objects.\n",
    "* using periodic and timeout events to drive plot updates\n",
    "* combining HoloViews plots with custom Bokeh plots to quickly write highly customized apps.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this guide we will cover how we can deploy a Bokeh app from a HoloViews plot in a number of different ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Inline from within the Jupyter notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Starting a server interactively and open it in a new browser window.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. From a standalone script file\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Combining HoloViews and Bokeh models to create a more customized app\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have read a bit about HoloViews you will know that HoloViews objects are not themselves plots, instead they contain sufficient data and metadata allowing them to be rendered automatically in a notebook context. In other words, when a HoloViews object is evaluated a backend specific ``Renderer`` converts the HoloViews object into Bokeh models, a Matplotlib figure or a Plotly graph. This intermediate representation is then rendered as an image or as HTML with associated Javascript, which is what ends up being displayed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "The most convenient way to work with HoloViews is to iteratively improve a visualization in the notebook. Once you have developed a visualization or dashboard that you would like to deploy you can use the ``BokehRenderer`` to export the visualization as illustrated above, or you can deploy it as a Bokeh server app. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here we will create a small interactive plot, using [Linked Streams](./12-Custom_Interactivity.ipynb), which mirrors the points selected using box- and lasso-select tools in a second plot and computes some statistics:"

Using the ``BokehRenderer`` we can easily convert a HoloViews object into a Bokeh model, which we can combine with other Bokeh models as desired.\n",

To display this in the notebook we will reuse what we learned about creating a ``Server`` instance using a ``FunctionHandler``, you can of course run this in a script by calling the ``modify_doc`` function with with the ``Document`` returned by the Bokeh ``curdoc()`` function."
