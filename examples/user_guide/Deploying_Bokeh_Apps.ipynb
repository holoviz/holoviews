    "## Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "HoloViews is an incredible convenient way of working interactively and exploratively within a notebook or commandline context, however when you have implemented a polished interactive dashboard or some other complex interactive visualization you often want to deploy it outside the notebook. The [bokeh server](http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/server.html) provides a very convenient way of deploying HoloViews plots and interactive dashboards in a scalable and flexible manner. The bokeh server allows all the usual interactions that HoloViews lets you define and more including:\n",
    "\n",
    "* responding to plot events and tool interactions via [Linked Streams](Linked_Stream.ipynb)\n",
    "* generating and interacting with plots via the usual widgets that HoloViews supports for HoloMap and DynamicMap objects.\n",
    "* using periodic and timeout events to drive plot updates\n",
    "* combining HoloViews plots with custom bokeh plots to quickly write highly customized apps.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this guide we will cover how we can deploy a bokeh app from a HoloViews plot in a number of different ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Inline from within the Jupyter notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Starting a server interactively and open it in a new browser window.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. From a standalone script file\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Combining HoloViews and Bokeh models to create a more customized app\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have read a bit about HoloViews you will know that HoloViews objects are not themselves plots, instead they contain sufficient data and metadata allowing them to be rendered automatically in a notebook context. In other words when a HoloViews object is evaluated a backend specific ``Renderer`` converts the HoloViews object into bokeh models, a matplotlib figure or a plotly graph. This intermediate representation is then rendered as an image or as HTML with associated Javascript, which is what ends up being displayed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "The most convenient way to work with HoloViews is to iteratively improve a visualization in the notebook. Once you have developed a visualization or dashboard that you would like to deploy you can use the ``BokehRenderer`` to save the visualization or deploy it as a bokeh server app. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here we will create a small interactive plot, using [Linked Streams](Linked_Streams.html), which mirrors the points selected using box- and lasso-select tools in a second plot and computes some statistics:"
