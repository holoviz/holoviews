    "When working with the bokeh backend in HoloViews complex interactivity can be achieved using very little code, whether that is shared axes, which zoom and pan together or shared datasources, which allow for linked cross-filtering. Separately it is possible to create custom interactions by attaching LinkedStreams to a plot and thereby triggering events on interactions with the plot. The Streams based interactivity affords a lot of flexibility to declare custom interactivity on a plot, however it always requires a live Python kernel to be connected either via the notebook or bokeh server. The ``Link`` classes described in this user guide however allow declaring interactions which do not require a live server, opening up the possibility of declaring complex interactions in a plot.\n",

    "## What is a Link?\n",
    "\n",
    "A Link defines some connection between a source and target object in their visualization. It is quite similar to a Stream as it allows defining callbacks in response to some change or event on the source object, however, unlike a Stream, it does not transfer data and make it available to user defined subscribers. Instead a Link directly causes some action to occur on the target, for JS based backends this usually means that a corresponding JS callback will effect some change on the target in response to a change on the source.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the simplest examples of a Link is the DataLink which links the data from two sources as long as they match in length, e.g. below we create two elements with data of the same length. By declaring a ``DataLink`` between the two we can ensure they are linked and can be selected together:"

To express this we declare a ``MeanHLineLink`` class subclassing from the ``Link`` baseclass and declare ``ClassSelector`` parameters with the appropriate types to perform some basic validation."
