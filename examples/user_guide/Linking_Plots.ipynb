    "When working with the bokeh backend in HoloViews complex interactivity can be achieved using very little code, whether that is shared axes, which zoom and pan together or shared datasources, which allow for linked cross-filtering. Separately it is possible to create custom interactions by attaching LinkedStreams to a plot and thereby triggering events on interactions with the plot. The Streams based interactivity affords a lot of flexibility to declare custom interactivity on a plot, however it always requires a live Python kernel to be connected either via the notebook or bokeh server. The ``Link`` classes described in this user guide however allow declaring interactions which do not require a live server, opening up the possibility of declaring complex interactions in a plot that can be exported to a static HTML file.\n",

    "## What is a ``Link``?\n",
    "\n",
    "A ``Link`` defines some connection between a source and target object in their visualization. It is quite similar to a ``Stream`` as it allows defining callbacks in response to some change or event on the source object, however, unlike a Stream, it does not transfer data between the browser and a Python process. Instead a ``Link`` directly causes some action to occur on the ``target``, for JS based backends this usually means that a corresponding JS callback will effect some change on the target in response to a change on the source.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the simplest examples of a ``Link`` is the ``DataLink`` which links the data from two sources as long as they match in length, e.g. below we create two elements with data of the same length. By declaring a ``DataLink`` between the two we can ensure they are linked and can be selected together:"

    "A ``Link`` consists of two components the ``Link`` itself and a ``LinkCallback`` which provides the actual implementation behind the ``Link``. In order to demonstrate writing a ``Link`` we'll start with a fairly straightforward example, linking an ``HLine`` or ``VLine`` to the mean value of a selection on a ``Scatter`` element. To express this we declare a ``MeanLineLink`` class subclassing from the ``Link`` baseclass and declare ``ClassSelector`` parameters for the ``source`` and ``target`` with the appropriate types to perform some basic validation. Additionally we declare a ``column`` parameter to specify which column to compute the mean on."

A ``LinkCallback`` should declare the ``source_model`` we want to listen to events on and a ``target_model``, declaring which model should be altered in response. To find out which models we can attach the ``Link`` to we can create a ``Plot`` instance and look at the ``plot.handles``, e.g. here we create a ``ScatterPlot`` and can see it has a 'cds', which represents the ``ColumnDataSource``."
