    "This example allows us to expand on the concepts introduced in the [Customization](../getting_started/2-Customization.ipynb) getting started guide. First, we note that two things are immediately apparent (1) almost all the customization is going on at the top of the cell, leaving the declaration of our elements and layout nearly unchanged and (2) this customization syntax that is specific to IPython and the Jupyter notebook and is *not* valid Python. We will use this syntax in this section but it is important to note that we have regular Python equivalents to these tools as will be described shortly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with the one difference to how our layout is declared, namely the use of ``.cols(1)`` at the end. If you delete the lines starting with ``%`` at the top of the cell and re-execute it, you will see this simply rearranges the default layout to a single column format, with the curve *above* the spikes instead of next to it.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "%%output size=150\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the *output cell magic* which customizes the output format of a particular cell by instructing the active plotting renderer with the desired size. There is a corresponding *cell line magic* to set things globally and a ``hv.output`` utility (for both local and global settings) that you can read about below. All these output tools accept a ``size`` options which in this case sets our plot size to 150% of the default.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "%%opts Curve  [height=100 width=600 xaxis=None show_grid=False tools=['hover']]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the *opts cell magic* which customizes the visual presentation of elements displayed in a particular cell. In this case, it specifies a set of keywords relevant to our ``Curve`` element in square brackets. These list of keywords are ***plot options*** that specify the settings that HoloViews is to use to plot ``Curve`` elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case we want to make an elongated ``Curve`` plot to make it easier to view the timeseries and to allow for a corresponding elongated spikes plot underneath which is why we specified the ``width`` and ``height`` keywords. We also want to disable the ``xaxis`` (our ``Curve`` plot will give us a suitable millisecond below). Finally with ``tools=['hover']`` we add the [Bokeh hover tool](http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/tools.html#hovertool) to our plot: try hovering your pointer over the red curve to see the exact values of each sample!\n",

    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "%%opts Curve (color='red' line_width=1.5)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, our list of keywords are in *parentheses* specifying  ***style options*** with are Bokeh specific and passed down directly from HoloViews to Bokeh. The ``color`` and ``line_width`` options are *not* part of the HoloViews API but keywords used to customize the appearance of [Bokeh glyphs](http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/plotting.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly we have use the ``%%opts`` cell magic to customize the appearance of our ``Spikes`` element:\n",

    "### Option specification syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the three types of visualization options in HoloViews:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Option types\n",
    "\n",
    "##### ``style`` options:\n",
    "\n",
    "``style`` options are passed directly to the underlying rendering backend that actually draws the plots, allowing you to control the details of how it behaves.  The default backend is matplotlib, but there are other backends either using matplotlib's options (e.g. ``mpld3``), or their own sets of options (e.g. [``bokeh``](Bokeh_Backend) ).\n",
    "\n",
    "For whichever backend has been selected, HoloViews can tell you which options are supported, but you will need to see the plotting library's own documentation (e.g. [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/contents.html), [bokeh](http://bokeh.pydata.org)) for the details of their use.\n",
    "\n",
    "HoloViews has been designed to be easily extensible to additional backends in the future, such as [Plotly](https://github.com/ioam/holoviews/pull/398), Cairo, VTK, or D3.js, and if one of those backends were selected then the supported style options would differ.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### ``plot`` options:\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of the various HoloViews plotting classes declares various [Parameters](http://ioam.github.io/param) that control how HoloViews builds the visualization for that type of object, such as plot sizes and labels.  HoloViews uses these options internally; they are not simply passed to the underlying backend.  HoloViews documents these options fully in its online help and in the [Reference Manual](http://holoviews.org/Reference_Manual).  These options may vary for different backends in some cases, depending on the support available both in that library and in the HoloViews interface to it, but we try to keep any options that are meaningful for a variety of backends the same for all of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### ``norm`` options:\n",
    "\n",
    "``norm`` options are a special type of plot option that are applied orthogonally to the above two types, to control normalization.  Normalization refers to adjusting the properties of one plot relative to those of another.  For instance, two images normalized together would appear with relative brightness levels, with the brightest image using the full range black to white, while the other image is scaled proportionally.  Two images normalized independently would both cover the full range from black to white.  Similarly, two axis ranges normalized together will expand to fit the largest range of either axis, while those normalized separately would cover different ranges. See the ``norm`` options section below.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Selecting with ``type``, ``group`` and ``label``\n",
    "\n",
    "The three types of option mentioned above can be associated with HoloViews objects at three levels of specificity: at the level of the element *type*, by the assigned element *group* and then by the assigned *label*.\n",
