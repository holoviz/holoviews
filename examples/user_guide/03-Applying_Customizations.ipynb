Option keywords can be specified for individual element instances, for all elements of a particular type, or for arbitrary user-defined sets of elements that you give a certain ``group`` and ``label`` (see [Annotating Data](../user_guide/01-Annotating_Data.ipynb)).\n",

    "## Maximizing readability\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many ways to specify options in your code using the above tools, but for creating readable, maintainable code, we recommend making the separation of content and presentation explicit. Someone reading your code can then understand your visualizations in two steps 1) what your data *is* in terms of the applicable elements and containers 2) how this data is to be presented visually.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following guide details the approach we have used through out the examples and guides on holoviews.org. We have found that following these rules makes code involving holoviews easier to read and more consistent.\n",
    "\n",
    "The core principle is as follows: ***avoid mixing declarations of data, elements and containers with details of their visual appearance***.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Two contrasting examples\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the best ways to do this is to declare all your elements, compose them and then apply all the necessary styling with the `.opts` method before the visualization is rendered to disk or to the screen. For instance, the example from the getting-started guide could have been written sub-optimally as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "***Sub-optimal***\n",
    "```python\n",
    "curve = hv.Curve( spike_train, 'milliseconds', 'Hertz').opts(\n",
    "    height=200, width=900, xaxis=None, line_width=1.50, color='red', tools=['hover'])\n",
    "spikes = hv.Spikes(spike_train, 'milliseconds', vdims=[]).opts(\n",
    "height=150, width=900, yaxis=None, line_width=0.25, color='grey')\n",
    "(curve + spikes).cols(1)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Code like that is very difficult to read because it mixes declarations of the data and its dimensions with details about how to present it.  The recommended version declares the `Layout`, then separately applies all the options together where it's clear that they are just hints for the visualization:\n",
    "\n",
    "***Recommended***\n",
    "```python\n",
    "curve  = hv.Curve( spike_train, 'milliseconds', 'Hertz')\n",
    "spikes = hv.Spikes(spike_train, 'milliseconds', [])\n",
    "layout = curve + spikes\n",
    "\n",
    "layout.opts(\n",
    "    opts.Curve( height=200, width=900, xaxis=None, line_width=1.50, color='red', tools=['hover']),\n",
    "    opts.Spikes(height=150, width=900, yaxis=None, line_width=0.25, color='grey')).cols(1)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "By grouping the options in this way and applying them at the end, you can see the definition of `layout` without being distracted by visual concerns declared later. Conversely, you can modify the visual appearance of `layout` easily without needing to know exactly how it was defined. The [coding style guide](#Coding-style-guide) section below offers additional advice for keeping things readable and consistent.\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to use multiple`.opts` calls\n",
    "\n",
    "The above coding style applies in many case, but sometimes you have multiple elements of the same type that you need to distinguish visually. For instance, you may have a set of curves where using the `dim` or `Cycle` objects (described in the [Style Mapping](04-Style_Mapping.ipynb) user guide) is not appropriate and you want to customize the appearance of each curve individually. Alternatively, you may be generating elements in a list comprehension for use in `NdOverlay` and have a specific style to apply to each one.\n",
    "\n",
    "In these situations, it is often appropriate to use the inline style of `.opts` locally. In these instances, it is often best to give the individually styled objects a suitable named handle as illustrated by the  [legend example](../gallery/demos/bokeh/legend_example.ipynb) of the gallery.\n",
    "\n",
    "### General advice\n",
    "\n",
    "As HoloViews is highly compositional by design, you can always build long expressions mixing the data and element declarations, the composition of these elements, and their customization. Even though such expressions can be terse they can also be difficult to read.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest way to avoid long expressions is to keep some level of separation between these stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. declaration of the data\n",
    "2. declaration of the elements, including `.opts` to distinguish between elements of the same type if necessary \n",
    "3. composition with `+` and `*` into layouts and overlays, and \n",
    "4. customization of the composite object, either with a final call to the `.opts` method, or by declaring such settings as the default for your entire session as described [above](#Session-specific-options).\n",
    "\n",
    "When stages are simple enough, it can be appropriate to combine them. For instance, if the declaration of the data is simple enough, you can fold in the declaration of the element. In general, any expression involving three or more of these stages will benefit from being broken up into several steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "These general principles will help you write more readable code. Maximizing readability will always require some level of judgement, but you can maximize consistency by consulting the [coding style guide](#Coding-style-guide) section for more tips."

    "\n",
    "The `.options` method was introduced in HoloViews 1.10 and was the first time HoloViews allowed users to ignore the distinction between 'style', 'plot' and 'norm' options described in the next section. It is largely equivalent to the `.opts` method except that it applies the options on a returned clone of the object.\n",

    "* `obj.options(**kwargs, clone=False)` is equivalent to `obj.opts(**kwargs)`\n",
    "\n",
    "For this reason, users only ever need to use `.opts` and occasionally supply `clone=True` if required. The only other difference between these methods is that `.opts` supports the full literal specification that allows splitting into [style, plot and norm options](#Split-into-style,-plot-and-norm-options) (for developers) whereas `.options` does not.\n",

For instance, we never customized the `spikes` object defined at the start of the notebook but we did customize it when it was part of a `Layout` called `layout`. Examining this `spikes` object, we see the options were applied to the underlying object, not just a copy of it in the layout:\n"

    "``style`` options are passed directly to the underlying rendering backend that actually draws the plots, allowing you to control the details of how it behaves.  Each backend has its own options (e.g. the [``bokeh``](Bokeh_Backend) or plotly backends).\n",
    "\n",
    "For whichever backend has been selected, HoloViews can tell you which options are supported, but you will need to read the corresponding documentation (e.g. [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/contents.html), [bokeh](http://bokeh.pydata.org)) for the details of their use.

HoloViews uses these options internally; they are not simply passed to the underlying backend.  HoloViews documents these options fully in its online help and in the [Reference Manual](http://holoviews.org/Reference_Manual).  These options may vary for different backends in some cases, depending on the support available both in that library and in the HoloViews interface to it, but we try to keep any options that are meaningful for a variety of backends the same for all of them. For listing available options, see the output of ``hv.help``.\n",

    "``norm`` options are a special type of plot option that are applied orthogonally to the above two types, to control normalization.  Normalization refers to adjusting the properties of one plot relative to those of another.  For instance, two images normalized together would appear with relative brightness levels, with the brightest image using the full range black to white, while the other image is scaled proportionally.  Two images normalized independently would both cover the full range from black to white.  Similarly, two axis ranges normalized together are effectively linked and will expand to fit the largest range of either axis, while those normalized separately would cover different ranges. For listing available options, see the output of ``hv.help``.\n",
