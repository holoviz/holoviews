It also specified that if the object contained a ``HoloMap`` (which this particular one does not), it would be saved in GIF format, which supports animation.  Because of the need for animation, objects containing a ``HoloMap`` are handled specially, as animation is not supported by the common PNG or SVG formats.\n",

SVG files can be be used in some document preparation programs directly (e.g. [LibreOffice](http://www.libreoffice.org/)), and can easily be converted using e.g. [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org) to PDF for use with PDFLaTeX or to EMF for use with Microsoft Word.  They can also be edited using Inkscape or other vector drawing programs to move graphical elements around, add arbitrary text, etc., if you need to make final tweaks before using the figures in a document.  You can also embed them within other SVG figures in such a drawing program, e.g. by creating a larger figure as a template that automatically incorporates multiple SVG files you have exported separately."
