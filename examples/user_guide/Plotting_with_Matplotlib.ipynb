It also specified that if the object contained a ``HoloMap`` (which this particular one does not), it would be saved in GIF format, which supports animation.

They can also be edited using Inkscape or other vector drawing programs to move graphical elements around, add arbitrary text, etc., if you need to make final tweaks before using the figures in a document.  You can also embed them within other SVG figures in such a drawing program, e.g. by creating a larger figure as a template that automatically incorporates multiple SVG files you have exported separately."
