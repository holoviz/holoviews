    "# Working with Streaming Data\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Streaming data\" is data that is continuously generated, often by some external source like a remote website, a measuring device, or a simulator. This kind of data is common for financial time series, web server logs, scientific applications, and many other situations. We have seen how to visualize any data output by a callable in the [Live Data](07-Live_Data.ipynb) user guide and we have also seen how to use the HoloViews stream system to push events in the user guide sections [Responding to Events](12-Responding_to_Events.ipynb) and [Custom Interactivity](13-Custom_Interactivity.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "This user guide shows a third way of building an interactive plot, using ``DynamicMap`` and streams.  Here, instead of pushing plot metadata (such as zoom ranges, user triggered events such as ``Tap`` and so on) to a ``DynamicMap`` callback, the underlying data in the visualized elements are updated directly using a HoloViews ``Stream``.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, we will show how the HoloViews ``Pipe`` and ``Buffer`` streams can be used to work with streaming data sources without having to fetch or generate the data from inside the ``DynamicMap`` callable. Apart from simply setting element data from outside a ``DynamicMap``.\n"

    "A ``Pipe`` allows data to be pushed into a DynamicMap callback to change a visualization, just like the streams in the [Responding to Events](./12-Responding_to_Events.ipynb) user guide were used to push changes to metadata that controlled the visualization. A ``Pipe`` can be used to push data of any type and make it available to a ``DynamicMap`` callback. Since all ``Element`` types accept ``data`` of various forms we can use ``Pipe`` to push data directly to the constructor of an ``Element`` through a DynamicMap.\n",

    "While ``Pipe`` provides a general solution for piping arbitrary data to ``DynamicMap`` callback,  ``Buffer`` on the other hand provides a very powerful means of working with streaming tabular data, defined as pandas dataframes, arrays or dictionaries of columns (as well as StreamingDataFrame, which we will cover later). ``Buffer`` automatically accumulates the last ``N`` rows of the tabular data, where ``N`` is defined by the ``length``.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ability to accumulate data allows performing operations on a recent history of data, while plotting backends (such as bokeh) can optimize plot updates by sending just the latest patch. This optimization works only if the ``data`` object held by the ``Buffer`` is identical to the plotted ``Element`` data, otherwise all the data will be updated as normal."
