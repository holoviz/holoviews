    "# Working with Streaming Data\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Streaming data\" is data that is continuously generated, often by some external source like a remote website, a measuring device, or a simulator. This kind of data is common for financial time series, web server logs, scientific applications, and many other situations. We have seen how to visualize any data output by a callable in the [Live Data](07-Live_Data.ipynb) user guide and we have also seen how to use the HoloViews stream system to push events in the user guide sections [Responding to Events](12-Responding_to_Events.ipynb) and [Custom Interactivity](13-Custom_Interactivity.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "This user guide shows a third way of building an interactive plot, using ``DynamicMap`` and streams.  Here, instead of pushing plot metadata (such as zoom ranges, user triggered events such as ``Tap`` and so on) to a ``DynamicMap`` callback, the underlying data in the visualized elements are updated directly using a HoloViews ``Stream``.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, we will show how the HoloViews ``Pipe`` and ``Buffer`` streams can be used to work with streaming data sources without having to fetch or generate the data from inside the ``DynamicMap`` callable. Apart from simply setting element data from outside a ``DynamicMap``, we will also explore ways of working with streaming data coordinated by the separate [``streamz``](http://matthewrocklin.com/blog/work/2017/10/16/streaming-dataframes-1) library from Matt Rocklin, which can make building complex streaming pipelines much simpler.\n",
    "\n",
    "As this notebook makes use of the ``streamz`` library, you will need to install it with ``conda install streamz`` or ``pip install streamz``."

Streamz is easy to use for simple tasks, but also supports complex pipelines that involve branching, joining, flow control, feedback and more.

    "## Asynchronous updates using the tornado ``IOLoop``\n",
    "\n",
    "In most cases, instead of pushing updates manually from the same Python process, you'll want the object to update asynchronously as new data arrives. Since both Jupyter and Bokeh server run on [tornado](http://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/), we can use the tornado ``IOLoop`` in both cases to define a non-blocking co-routine that can push data to our stream whenever it is ready. The ``PeriodicCallback`` makes this approach very simple, we simply define a function which will be called periodically with a timeout defined in milliseconds. Once we have declared the callback we can call ``start`` to begin emitting events:"
