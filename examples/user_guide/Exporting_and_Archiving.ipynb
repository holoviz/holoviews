In this notebook, we show how HoloViews works together with the Jupyter Notebook to establish a fully interactive yet *also* fully reproducible scientific or engineering workflow for generating reports or publications.  That is, as you interactively explore your data and build visualizations in the notebook, you can automatically generate and export them as figures that will feed directly into your papers or web pages, along with records of how those figures were generated and even storing the actual data involved so that it can be re-analyzed later. \n",

    "## Using HoloViews to do reproducible research\n",
    "\n",
    "The export options from HoloViews help you establish a feasible workflow for doing reproducible research: starting from interactive exploration, either export specific files with ``hv.save``, or enable ``hv.archive.auto()``, which will store a copy of your notebook and its output ready for inclusion in a document but retaining the complete recipe for reproducing the results later.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Why reproducible research matters\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand why these capabilities are important, let's consider the process by which scientific results are typically generated and published without HoloViews.  Scientists and engineers use a wide variety of data-analysis tools, ranging from GUI-based programs like Excel spreadsheets, mixed GUI/command-line programs like Matlab, or purely scriptable tools like matplotlib or bokeh.  The process by which figures are created in any of these tools typically involves copying data from its original source, selecting it, transforming it, choosing portions of it to put into a figure, choosing the various plot options for a subfigure, combining different subfigures into a complete figure, generating a publishable figure file with the full figure, and then inserting that into a report or publication.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If using GUI tools, often the final figure is the only record of that process, and even just a few weeks or months later a researcher will often be completely unable to say precisely how a given figure was generated.  Moreover, this process needs to be repeated whenever new data is collected, which is an error-prone and time-consuming process. The lack of records is a serious problem for building on past work and revisiting the assumptions involved, which greatly slows progress both for individual researchers and for the field as a whole.  Graphical environments for capturing and replaying a user's GUI-based workflow have been developed, but these have greatly restricted the process of exploration, because they only support a few of the many analyses required, and thus they have rarely been successful in practice.  With GUI tools it is also very difficult to \"curate\" the sequence of steps involved, i.e., eliminating dead ends, speculative work, and unnecessary steps, with a goal of showing the clear path from incoming data to a final figure.\n",
    "\n",
    "In principle, using scriptable or command-line tools offers the promise of capturing the steps involved, in a form that can be curated.  In practice, however, the situation is often no better than with GUI tools, because the data is typically taken through many manual steps that culminate in a published figure, and without a laboriously manually created record of what steps are involved, the provenance of a given figure remains unknown.  Where reproducible workflows are created in this way, they tend to be \"after the fact\", as an explicit exercise to accompany a publication, and thus (a) they are rarely done, (b) they are very difficult to do if any of the steps were not recorded originally.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A Jupyter notebook helps significantly to make the scriptable-tools approach viable, by recording both code and the resulting output, and can thus in principle act as a record for establishing the full provenance of a figure.  But because typical plotting libraries require so much plotting-specific code before any plot is visible, the notebook quickly becomes unreadable.  To make notebooks readable, researchers then typically move the plotting code for a specific figure to some external file, which then drifts out of sync with the notebook so that the notebook no longer acts as a record of the link between the original data and the resulting figure.  \n",
    "\n",
    "HoloViews provides the final missing piece in this approach, by allowing researchers to work directly with their data interactively in a notebook, using small amounts of code that focus on the data and analyses rather than plotting code, yet showing the results directly alongside the specification for generating them.  This user guide will describe how use a Jupyter notebook with HoloViews to export your results in a way that preserves the information about how those results were generated, providing a clear chain of provenance and making reproducible research practical at last.\n",
