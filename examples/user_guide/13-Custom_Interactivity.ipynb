    "In previous notebooks we discovered how the ``DynamicMap`` class allows us to declare objects in a lazy way to enable exploratory analysis of large parameter spaces. In the [Responding to Events](./12-Responding_to_Events.ipynb) guide we learned how to interactively push updates to existing plots by declaring Streams on a DynamicMap. In this user guide we will extend the idea to so called *linked* Streams, which allows complex interactions to be declared by specifying which events should be exposed when a plot is interacted with. By passing information about live interactions to a simple Python based callback, you will be able to build richer, even more interactive visualizations that enable seamless data exploration.\n",
