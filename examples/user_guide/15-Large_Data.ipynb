    "# Working with large data using Datashader\n",
    "\n",
    "The various plotting-library backends supported by HoloViews, such as Matplotlib and Bokeh, each have a variety of limitations on the amount of data that is practical to work with.  Bokeh in particular mirrors your data directly into an HTML page viewable in your browser, which can cause problems when data sizes approach the limited memory available for each web page in current browsers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily, a visualization of even the largest dataset will be constrained by the resolution of your display device, and so one approach to handling such data is to pre-render or rasterize the data into a fixed-size array or image *before* sending it to the backend.  The [Datashader](https://github.com/bokeh/datashader) library provides a high-performance big-data server-side rasterization pipeline that works seamlessly with HoloViews to support datasets that are orders of magnitude larger than those supported natively by the plotting-library backends, including millions or billions of points even on ordinary laptops.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we will see how and when to use Datashader with HoloViews Elements and Containers. For simplicity in this discussion we'll focus on simple synthetic datasets, but the [Datashader docs](http://datashader.org/topics) include a wide variety of real datasets that give a much better idea of the power of using Datashader with HoloViews, and [PyViz.org](http://pyviz.org) shows how to install and work with HoloViews and Datashader together.\n",

So even for very large datasets, you can easily  specify a data structure that you can work with for making selections, sampling, aggregations, and so on.

The middle plot above shows the result of using `datashade()` to create a dynamic Datashader-based plot out of an Element with arbitrarily large data.  In the Datashader version, a new image is regenerated automatically on every zoom or pan event, revealing all the data available at that zoom level and avoiding issues with overplotting by dynamically rescaling the colors used.  The same process is used for the line-based data in the Paths plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "These two Datashader-based plots are similar to the native Bokeh plots above, but instead of making a static Bokeh plot that embeds points or line segments directly into the browser, HoloViews sets up a Bokeh plot with dynamic callbacks that render the data as an RGB image using Datashader instead.  The dynamic re-rendering provides an interactive user experience even though the data itself is never provided directly to the browser.  Of course, because the full data is not in the browser, a static export of this page (e.g. on holoviews.org or on anaconda.org) will only show the initially rendered version, and will not update with new images when zooming as it will when there is a live Python process available.\n",

It will get a bit slower, but if you have enough memory, it should still be very usable, and should never crash your browser as transferring the whole dataset into your browser would.  If you don't have enough memory, you can instead set up a [Dask](http://dask.pydata.org) dataframe as shown in other Datashader examples, which will provide out-of-core and/or distributed processing to handle even the largest datasets.\n",

    "In all three of the above plots, `rasterize()` is being called to aggregate the data (a large set of x,y locations) into a rectangular grid, with each grid cell counting up the number of points that fall into it.  In the plot on the left, only `rasterize()` is done, and the resulting numeric array of counts is passed to Bokeh for colormapping.  Bokeh can then use dynamic (client-side, browser-based) operations in JavaScript, allowing users to have dynamic control over  even static HTML plots.  For instance, in this case, users can use the Box Select tool and select a range of the histogram shown, dynamically remapping the colors used in the plot to cover the selected range.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other two plots should be identical.  In both cases, the numerical array output of `rasterize()` is mapped into RGB colors by Datashader itself, in Python (\"server-side\"), which allows special Datashader computations like the histogram-equalization in the above plots and the \"spreading\" discussed below.  The `shade()` and `datashade()` operations accept a `cmap` argument that lets you control the colormap used, which can be selected to match the HoloViews/Bokeh `cmap` option but is strictly independent of it.  See ``hv.help(rasterize)``,  ``hv.help(shade)``, and ``hv.help(datashade)`` for options that can be selected, and the [Datashader web site](http://datashader.org) for all the details. The lower-level `aggregate()` and `regrid()` give more control over how the data is aggregated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since datashader only sends the data currently in view to the plotting backend, the default behavior is to rescale colormap to the range of the visible data as the zoom level changes. This behavior may not be desirable when working with images; to instead use a fixed colormap range, the `clim` parameter can be passed to the `bokeh` backend via the `opts()` method. Note that this approach works with `rasterize()` where the colormapping is done by the `bokeh` backend. With `datashade()`, the colormapping is done with the `shade()` function which takes a `clims` parameter directly instead of passing additional parameters to the backend via `opts()`."

    "Fundamentally, what datashader does is to rasterize data, i.e., render a representation of it into a regularly gridded rectangular portion of a two-dimensional plane.  Datashader natively supports six basic types of rasterization:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **points**: zero-dimensional objects aggregated by position alone, each point covering zero area in the plane and thus falling into exactly one grid cell of the resulting array (if the point is within the bounds being aggregated).\n",
    "- **line**: polyline/multiline objects (connected series of line segments), with each segment having a fixed length but zero width and crossing each grid cell at most once.\n",
    "- **area**: a region to fill either between the supplied y-values and the origin or between two supplied lines\n",
    "- **trimesh**: irregularly spaced triangular grid, with each triangle covering a portion of the 2D plane and thus potentially crossing multiple grid cells (thus requiring interpolation/upsampling). Depending on the zoom level, a single pixel can also include multiple triangles, which then becomes similar to the `points` case (requiring aggregation/downsampling of all triangles covered by the pixel).\n",
    "- **raster**: an axis-aligned regularly gridded two-dimensional subregion of the plane, with each grid cell in the source data covering more than one grid cell in the output grid (requiring interpolation/upsampling), or with each grid cell in the output grid including contributions from more than one grid cell in the input grid (requiring aggregation/downsampling).\n",
    "- **quadmesh**: a recti-linear or curvi-linear mesh (like a raster, but allowing nonuniform spacing and coordinate mapping) where each quad can cover one or more cells in the output (requiring upsampling, currently only as nearest neighbor), or with each output grid cell including contributions from more than one input grid cell (requiring aggregation/downsampling).\n",
    "- **polygons**:  arbitrary filled shapes in 2D space (bounded by a piecewise linear set of segments), optionally punctuated by similarly bounded internal holes\n",

    "# Optimizing performance\n",
    "\n",
    "Datashader and HoloViews have different design principles that are worth keeping in mind when using them in combination, if you want to ensure good overall performance. By design, Datashader supports only a small number of operations and datatypes, focusing only on what can be implemented very efficiently.  HoloViews instead focuses on supporting the typical workflows of Python users, recognizing that the most computationally efficient choice is only going to be faster overall if it also minimizes the time users have to spend getting things working. \n",
    "\n",
    "HoloViews thus helps you get something working quickly, but once it is working and you realize that you need to do this often or that it comes up against the limits of your computing hardware, you can consider whether you can get much better performance by considering the following issues and suggestions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use a Datashader-supported data structure\n",
    "\n",
    "HoloViews helpfully tries to convert whatever data you have provided into what Datashader supports, which is good for optimizing your time to an initial solution, but will not always be the fastest approach computationally.  If you ensure that you store your data in a format that Datashader understands already, HoloViews can simply pass it down to Datashader without copying or transforming it:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For point, line, and trimesh data, Datashader supports Dask and Pandas dataframes, and so those two data sources will be fastest. Of those two, Dask Dataframes will usually be somewhat faster and also able to make use of distributed computational resources and out-of-core processing.\n",
    "2. For rasters and quadmeshes, Datashader supports xarray objects natively, and so if your data is provided as an xarray already, plotting will be faster.\n",
    "3. For polygons Datashader supports [spatialpandas](https://github.com/holoviz/spatialpandas) DataFrames.\n",
    "\n",
    "See the [Datashader docs](http://datashader.org) for examples of dealing with even quite large datasets (in the billions of points) on commodity hardware, including many HoloViews-based examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cache initial processing with `precompute=True`\n",
    "\n",
    "In the typical case of having datasets much larger than the plot resolution, HoloViews Datashader-based operations that work on the full dataset (`rasterize`, `aggregate`,`regrid`) are computationally expensive; the others are not (`shade`, `spread`, `dynspread`, etc.) \n",
    "\n",
    "The expensive operations are all of type `ResamplingOperation`, which has a parameter `precompute` (see `hv.help(hv.operation.datashader.rasterize)`, etc.)  Precompute can be used to get faster performance in interactive usage by caching the last set of data used in plotting (*after* any transformations needed) and reusing it when it is requested again. This is particularly useful when your data is not in one of the supported data formats already and needs to be converted. `precompute` is False by default, because it requires using memory to store the cached data, but if you have enough memory, you can enable it so that repeated interactions (such as zooming and panning) will be much faster than the first one.  In practice, most Datashader-plots don't need to do extensive precomputing, but enabling it for TriMesh and Polygon plots can greatly speed up interactive usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use GPU support\n",
    "\n",
    "Many elements now also support aggregation directly on a GPU-based datastructure such as a [cuDF DataFrame](https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf) or an Xarray DataArray backed by a [cupy](https://github.com/cupy/cupy) array. These data structures can be passed directly to the appropriate HoloViews elements just as you would use a Pandas or other Xarray object. For instance, a cuDF can be used on elements like `hv.Points` and `hv.Curve`, while a cupy-backed DataArray raster or quadmesh can be passed to `hv.QuadMesh` elements. When used with Datashader, the GPU implementation can result in 10-100x speedups, as well as avoiding having to transfer the data out of the GPU for plotting (sending only the final rendered plot out of the GPU's memory). To see which HoloViews elements are supported, see the [datashader performance guide](https://datashader.org/user_guide/Performance.html). As of the Datashader 0.11 release, all point, line, area, and quadmesh aggregations are supported when using a GPU backed datastructure, including raster objects like `hv.Image` if first converted to `hv.Quadmesh`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project data only once\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are working with geographic data using [GeoViews](http://geoviews.org) that needs to be projected before display and/or before datashading, GeoViews will have to do this every time you update a plot, which can drown out the performance improvement you get by using Datashader.  GeoViews allows you to project the entire dataset at once using `gv.operation.project`, and once you do this you should be able to use Datashader at full speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you follow these suggestions, the combination of HoloViews and Datashader will allow you to work uniformly with data covering a huge range of sizes. Per session or per plot, you can trade off the ability to export user-manipulable plots against file size and browser compatibility, and allowing you to render even the largest dataset faithfully. HoloViews makes the full power of Datashader available in just a few lines of code, giving you a natural way to work with your data regardless of its size."
