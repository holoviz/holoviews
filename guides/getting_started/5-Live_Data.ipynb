The data of interest may exist on some remote server making it unavailable locally until it is fetched. In other situations, the data may exist on the local disk but be too large to fit into memory. Perhaps the data doesn't even exit yet: it may be the result of some computation yet to be performed or the outcome of some live live process with the corresponding measurement not yet made.\n",
