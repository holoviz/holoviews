statistics elements and a complete overhaul of the geometry elements.

Particular thanks to all users and contributers who have reported
issues and submitted pull requests.

Features:

-   The kdim and vdim keyword arguments are now positional making the
    declaration of elements less verbose (e.g. Scatter(data, 'x',
    'y')) ([\#1946](https://github.com/ioam/holoviews/pull/1946))
-   Added Graph, Nodes, and EdgePaths elements adding support for
    plotting network graphs
    ([\#1829](https://github.com/ioam/holoviews/pull/1829))

-   A large range of other bug fixes too long to list here.

Changes affecting backwards compatibility:

-   The contours operation no longer overlays the contours on top of
    the supplied Image by default and returns a single
    Contours/Polygons rather than an NdOverlay of them
    ([\#1991](https://github.com/ioam/holoviews/pull/1991))

    \#393](https://github.com/ioam/holoviews/pull/393))

Version 1.4.1
=============

Over the past two weeks since the 1.4 release, we have implemented
several important bug fixes and have made several usability
improvements.

New features:

-   Improved help system. It is now possible to recursively list all the
    applicable documentation for a composite object. In addition, the
    documentation may now be filtered using a regular
    expression pattern. ([PR
    \#370](https://github.com/ioam/holoviews/pull/370))
-   HoloViews now supports multiple active display hooks making it
    easier to use nbconvert. For instance, PNG data will be embedded in
    the notebook if the argument display\_formats=\['html','png'\] is
    supplied to the notebook\_extension. ([PR
    \#355](https://github.com/ioam/holoviews/pull/355))
-   Improvements to the display of DynamicMaps as well as many new
    improvements to the Bokeh backend including better VLines/HLines and
    support for the Bars element. ([PR
    \#367](https://github.com/ioam/holoviews/pull/367) , [PR
    \#362](https://github.com/ioam/holoviews/pull/362), [PR
    \#339](https://github.com/ioam/holoviews/pull/339)).
-   New Spikes and BoxWhisker elements suitable for representing
    distributions as a sequence of lines or as a box-and-whisker plot.
    ([PR \#346](https://github.com/ioam/holoviews/pull/346), [PR
    \#339](https://github.com/ioam/holoviews/pull/339))
-   Improvements to the notebook\_extension. For instance,
    executing hv.notebook\_extension('bokeh') will now load BokehJS and
    automatically activate the Bokeh backend (if available).
-   Significant performance improvements when using the groupby
    operation on HoloMaps and when working with highly
    nested datastructures. ([PR
    \#349](https://github.com/ioam/holoviews/pull/349), [PR
    \#359](https://github.com/ioam/holoviews/pull/359))

Notable bug fixes:

-   DynamicMaps are now properly integrated into the style system and
    can be customized in the same way as HoloMaps. ([PR
    \#368](https://github.com/ioam/holoviews/pull/368))
-   Widgets now work correctly when unicode is used in the dimension
    labels and values ([PR
    \#376](https://github.com/ioam/holoviews/pull/376)).

Version 1.4.0
=============

Over the past few months we have added several major new features and
with the help of our users have been able to address a number of bugs
and inconsistencies. We have closed 57 issues and added over 1100 new
commits.

Major new features:

-   Data API: The new data API brings an extensible system of to add new
    data interfaces to column based Element types. These interfaces
    allow applying powerful operations on the data independently of the
    data format. The currently supported datatypes include NumPy, pandas
    dataframes and a simple dictionary format. ([PR
    \#284](https://github.com/ioam/holoviews/pull/284))
-   Backend API: In this release we completely refactored the rendering,
    plotting and IPython display system to make it easy to add new
    plotting backends. Data may be styled and pickled for each backend
    independently and renderers now support exporting all plotting data
    including widgets as standalone HTML files or with separate
    JSON data.
-   Bokeh backend: The first new plotting backend added via the new
    backend API. Bokeh plots allow for much faster plotting and
    greater interactivity. Supports most Element types and layouts and
    provides facilities for sharing axes across plots and linked
    brushing across plots. ([PR
    \#250](https://github.com/ioam/holoviews/pull/250))
-   DynamicMap: The new DynamicMap class allows HoloMap data to be
    generated on-the-fly while running a Jupyter IPython
    notebook kernel. Allows visualization of unbounded data streams and
    smooth exploration of large continuous parameter spaces. ([PR
    \#278](https://github.com/ioam/holoviews/pull/278))

Other features:

-   Easy definition of custom aliases for group, label and Dimension
    names, allowing easier use of LaTeX.
-   New Trisurface and QuadMesh elements.
-   Widgets now allow expressing hierarchical relationships
    between dimensions.
-   Added GridMatrix container for heterogeneous Elements and gridmatrix
    operation to generate scatter matrix showing relationship
    between dimensions.
-   Filled contour regions can now be generated using the
    contours operation.
-   Consistent indexing semantics for all Elements and support for
    boolean indexing for Columns and NdMapping types.
-   New hv.notebook\_extension function offers a more flexible
    alternative to %load\_ext, e.g. for loading other
    extensions hv.notebook\_extension(bokeh=True).

Experimental features:

-   Bokeh callbacks allow adding interactivity by communicating between
    bokehJS tools and the IPython kernel, e.g. allowing downsampling
    based on the zoom level.

Notable bug fixes:

-   Major speedup rendering large HoloMaps (\~ 2-3 times faster).
-   Colorbars now consistent for all plot configurations.
-   Style pickling now works correctly.

API Changes:

-   Dimension formatter parameter now deprecated in favor
    of value\_format.
-   Types of Chart and Table Element data now dependent on
    selected interface.
-   DFrame conversion interface deprecated in favor of Columns
    pandas interface.

Version 1.3.2
=============

-   Fixed overlaying of 3D elements (787d511).
-   Ensuring that underscore.js is loaded in widgets (f2f6378).
-   Fixed Python3 issue in Overlay.get (8ceabe3).

Version 1.3.1
=============

Minor bugfix release to address a number of issues that weren't caught
in time for the 1.3.0 release with the addition of a small number of
features:

Features:

-   Introduced new `Spread` element to plot errors and confidence
    intervals (30d3184).
-   `ErrorBars` and `Spread` elements now allow most Chart constructor
    types (f013deb).

Bug fixes:

-   Fixed unicode handling for dimension labels (061e9af).
-   Handling of invalid dimension label characters in widgets (a101b9e).
-   Fixed setting of fps option for MPLRenderer video output (c61b9df).
-   Fix for multiple and animated colorbars (5e1e4b5).
-   Fix to Chart slices starting or ending at zero (edd0039).

Version 1.3.0
=============

Since the last release we closed over 34 issues and have made 380
commits mostly focused on fixing bugs, cleaning up the API and working
extensively on the plotting and rendering system to ensure HoloViews is
fully backend independent.

We'd again like to thank our growing user base for all their input,
which has helped us in making the API more understandable and fixing a
number of important bugs.

Highlights/Features:

-   Allowed display of data structures which do not match the
    recommended nesting hierarchy (67b28f3, fbd89c3).
-   Dimensions now sanitized for `.select`, `.sample` and `.reduce`
    calls (6685633, 00b5a66).
-   Added `holoviews.ipython.display` function to render (and display)
    any HoloViews object, useful for IPython interact widgets (0fa49cd).
-   Table column widths now adapt to cell contents (be90a54).
-   Defaulting to matplotlib ticking behavior (62e1e58).
-   Allowed specifying fixed figure sizes to matplotlib via `fig_inches`
    tuples using (width, None) and (None, height) formats (632facd).
-   Constructors of `Chart`, `Path` and `Histogram` classes now support
    additional data formats (2297375).
-   `ScrubberWidget` now supports all figure formats (c317db4).
-   Allowed customizing legend positions on `Bars` Elements (5a12882).
-   Support for multiple colorbars on one axis (aac7b92).
-   `.reindex` on `NdElement` types now support converting between key
    and value dimensions allowing more powerful conversions. (03ac3ce)
-   Improved support for casting between `Element` types (cdaab4e,
    b2ad91b, ce7fe2d, 865b4d5).
-   The `%%opts` cell magic may now be used multiple times in the same
    cell (2a77fd0)
-   Matplotlib rcParams can now be set correctly per figure (751210f).
-   Improved `OptionTree` repr which now works with eval (2f824c1).
-   Refactor of rendering system and IPython extension to allow easy
    swapping of plotting backend (\#141)
-   Large plotting optimization by computing tight `bbox_inches`
    once (e34e339).
-   Widgets now cache frames in the DOM, avoiding flickering in some
    browsers and make use of jinja2 template inheritance. (fc7dd2b)
-   Calling a HoloViews object without arguments now clears any
    associated custom styles. (9e8c343)

API Changes

-   Renamed key\_dimensions and value\_dimensions to kdims and vdims
    respectively, while providing backward compatibility for passing and
    accessing the long names (8feb7d2).
-   Combined x/y/zticker plot options into x/y/zticks parameters which
    now accept an explicit number of ticks, an explicit list of tick
    positions (and labels), and a matplotlib tick locator.
-   Changed backend options in %output magic, `nbagg` and `d3` are now
    modes of the matplotlib backend and can be selected with
    `backend='matplotlib:nbagg'` and
    `backend='matplotlib:mpld3'` respectively. The 'd3' and 'nbagg'
    options remain supported but will be deprecated in future.
-   Customizations should no longer be applied directly to
    `Store.options`; the `Store.options(backend='matplotlib')` object
    should be customized instead. There is no longer a need to call the
    deprecated `Store.register_plots` method.

Version 1.2.0
=============

Since the last release we closed over 20 issues and have made 334
